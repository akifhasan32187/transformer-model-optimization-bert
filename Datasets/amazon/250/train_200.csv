0,Product description incorrect!,"The description clearly states that you are purchasing a ""set"". All you get is a single tuning fork. Perhaps the $60 package will include a full set."
0,Didn't get what was paid for.,"Product DescriptionEvaluate hearing and vibratory sensation. Set of 6 of the most commonly used frequencies contains the following tuning forks (128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4095 cps).This is description of what I should have been sent. Instead I was sent 1 small unweighted tuning forl..I will not be ordering from this place again. And wlll complain to amason itself to allowing this continue going on from this seller.sKim"
0,"Only ONE! Not the perceived (and advertised) ""set.""","I need to pay attention to the fine print and reviews. I, too, am a teacher, and did not realize I was ordering just ONE tuning fork, when the image clearly shows a boxed set. I am not even sure what ""512 cps weighted"" means. I hope I can use this tuning fork for its intendend purpose. I wish the company would have been more clear with its advertising and description."
0,Broken Tuning Fork,"When I received the tuning fork it was broken! If you are looking for a tuning fork and actually need it to work, DO NOT buy it from them. They are super cheap for a reason. Guess I learned my lesson."
0,Quite a disappointment!,"I remember the studio versions of ""Since You've Been Gone"" and ""Never Been Any Reason"" from my college years, and the live versions on this album fall way-flop flat by comparison -- tinny, out of harmony and just not there. The band rocked, but the less-than-original membership on this concert really shows. Rats!"
0,This collection does not represent this fine band,The band is great but this collection is not...find others from Head East and discover the rich rock sound of their hits of the 70s.
0,Not a very good quality,"Sounds like an old 8 track, but I do love the songs. I wish I had read the reviews before I paid for this to be downloaded. I saw Head East back in '77 and I had the old ""Live"" double LP. So was it worth the 9.99? Yeah I guess so. I think that Amazon. com should give me a credit though."
0,head east concert classics vol. 7,"After trying to listen to this autrocity, I decided the best place for it was the garbage can.This CD was absolutely horrible. I went and got my cassette version of Head Est Live out.Whoever did this should really be ashamed of themselves.I would have rated it lower it that was possible."
0,Oh the Horror!,"Please, please do not spend one thin dime on this total piece of drek! I owned a copy of the original ""Head East Live"" back in the day and this my friends is no ""Head East Live""! There should be consumer laws to prevent such as this from being sold. It is a cryin' shame we can't have the real thing and instead are given this abomination. It truly sounds like it was recorded straight to an 8-Track cartridge in someones basement. One can only hope that one day we can enjoy the original live release from this excellent 70's band."
0,Concert Classics vol. 7,Don't waste your money. Save it for when the real Head East Live comes out if it ever does. If someone offers you this CD for free don't take it! Who ever released this CD should not be allowed to work in the business and should work in the sign language business because their ears obviously don't work. What a rotten trick to play on Head East fans.
0,Don't even think about it!,"Head East remains one of my favorite rock bands of all time. However, this CD sounds like it was recorded on a $20 box in a concrete room using a deaf man as an engineer. I couldn't have been more disappointed with the quality of this disc. The liner notes were also horrendous! (Choppy, misspellings) It appears that the same care was taken writing these as was in producing this disc. If you want quality live Head East product, beg, then wait for Head East Live on disc. If I were a band member, I'd be furious with this release! Fortunately, I know how good they really are live. Beware the words ""Concert Classics""."
0,CONSUMER RIPOFF!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,I have waited some 20 years for someone to put out the HEAD EAST LIVE LP on cd.I decided to get this as a substitute.WHAT A JOKE!!It sounds like it was recorded in someones bathroom .The worst sounding cd I have ever heard!!Flush it down the toilet if you made the same mistake I did.Save your money and hope someone puts out the live lp release
0,Sad representation of Head East,"This truly is a poor excuse for a CD. The sound is poor, the performances sadly under represents the band. Head East was an energetic band, their music had a definite zest and vitality. Avoid this product at all costs. A&M needs to give some serious thought to re-releasing Head East Live. (Yes, re-release Head East Live was available for a short time as a domestic release, why it was pulled we'll never know). Hopefully A&M will realize there are people looking for this CD out there. In the meantime you can get the abbreviated version of Head East Live by buying Head East Live on Stage. Flat as a Pancake is also an enjoyable alternative."
0,not impressed,"Since I've had no luck finding a copy of Head East Live! I thought this might be comparable. In my opinion, it's a lousy substitute. The live album was awesome! Concert Classics has lousy sound, the vocals are lacking. It sounds 'thrown together' after a long night of partying. Wish I could send it back for the real thing. Sorry guys."
0,A little disappointing,"I just couldn't get into this music. I love rockabilly style music, but it just didn't do it for me. I wanted to like the band, I tried to like the band, but I just don't like the band. Every song sounds the same to me."
0,From a reader in Indiana-,"Many pictures, but some projects and info somewhat outdated. Didn't dicuss new container blend waxes or specific sizes of wicks needed for various candles. It does give specific instructions for whipped and inclusion candles,which I found interesting. Gives detailed lists of items needed for each project."
0,French kissing in the USA,"This doll has a limited vocabulary and as such would not be a great purchase for someone wishing to grasp the basic fundamentals of the French language. It only has six stock phrases - and in all honesty these are a little patronising. ""I like to shop"" and ""When I grow up I want to be a fashion designer"". At no point does this doll grunt ""25 Euros"" to you whilst proffering half a pint of warm, flat generic Belgian lager in a lipstick smeared, chipped glass."
0,never got it,"I don't wan to give this any stars, they sent the wrong item ,got it 2 days before Christmas,called the company never got any call backs. Would tell everyone not to order fro them!"
0,"For the love of god people, don't store your whiskey in lead crystal","Looks nice but is overpriced. Lead crystal is dirt cheap. Additionally, there is sufficient evidence to say lead crystal is not suitable for long term storage of whiskey. Unlikely they are going to make note of this in the product description.This is a great buy if you have cash to burn and want a decorative yet useless glass bottle."
0,Sent Wrong Decanter!!!,They Sent me the wrong decanter! problem was i needed it for a party i was having and just used it anyway and now i'm stuck with it.. pretty frustrated!
0,Not as Pictured,"Though the packaging states Godinger Dublin, the decanter I received has a different design and lid (flat and square). If you do a search for Godinger Dublin Whiskey on Amazon the one I received when ordering THIS one is THAT one. Not pleased. Also, the tray is a pretty cheap and flimsy affair, and setting this next to my decanters from Waterford makes it look like glass next to crystal. Be forewarned. You don't get what you pay for here.To make it worse, I would avoid all Godinger decanters with this flat/square-type of stopper because it isn't level and is unsightly.I like the design of this decanter as pictured but the execution leaves a lot to be desired."
0,Lead Decanter,The set looks nice. Just make sure you are aware that this decanter is made with lead crystal. I did not realize it when I bought it for someone as a gift. I had to return it (which meant taking it to a UPS store and paying for the return shipping which was not cheap) and they take a 15% restocking fee.
0,This DVD was Poor in Quality,"I was very disappointed in this DVD, the special features promised on this DVD, did not work, the viewing quality was poor, the DVD paused in several places, and froze up, so i could not enjoy the movie at all , it was not what i expected from a disney movie!!! would not buy this DVD if i were you, its a waste of money!!!"
0,design,Overall construction is good however the side top edge does not have a cushion for the ankle bone . This caused an abrasion under the ankle. Product was returned and credit was issue in a satisfactory manner.
0,A treatise on the authors life experience,"If you want to read about the authors life experiences rather than keeping, breeding and care of Angelfish, this book is for you. I ordered it thinking it would deal with the latter, not the former and was ratherdisapointed in its contents. I suppose that Drs. Axelrod and Burger have led active tropical fish hunting expeditions and thought they should share their adventures with the readers. I think you would be better off with an early edition of William T. Innes ""Exotic Aquarium Fish"". It has a detailed write-up on the keeping, breeding and care of fresh water Angelfish. Although this book has been out of print for many years, It may still be available on eBay or gathering dust in some book stores."
0,not very good,"This book wasnt worth it at all, he hardly talks about anything the average owner wants to know about...he mostly talks about the wild strains, and how he went out in search of them!"
0,BEWARE ordering this if you want TWO DISCS!,"I too ordered this thinking it was two discs. I even wrote AMAZON customer service asking them to confirm it was TWO CDs! They told me it was TWO CDs. I bought it and only ONE arrived. I'm returning this and I have already ordered a different version that has a sticker saying ""BONUS CD INCLUDED!""Put this Item # B00016B9F8 into your Amazon.com search to find it. It cost less too! It just better be the right one or I will rip Amazon sellers on that one too. If I post a positive review there, you'll KNOW it has TWO DISCS!So, just to be clear: this review is 1 star because someone cannot get their facts straight. It is NOT AT ALL reflective of the songs or material included!The songs are a ""best of"" and the songs that I'd heard before buying this are indeed great songs. I have heard all of the other songs and they're great too (Especially ""Superloud""!)PG is simply amazing. Just be sure what you're ordering and that you're getting what you wanted."
0,Old and flawed,"This book is a xerox copy of a very old tome that came before the days when they knew how the Indo-European languages were related. The core assumption of this book is WRONG, that is, that Latin springs from Greek. We all know now that Greek and Latin are cousin languages which both sprang from Indo-European. This book, besides this major misconception, is riddled with errors. Nonetheless, it's a useful work and a fun read for word nerds."
0,Kind of Dry History,"This book was full of history and an indictment of Saudi Arabia, but it was kind of dry to sit and read. If you like politics and history of the Saudi Government, you will find this book appealing. Christ is King!"
0,from someone lives there,"guess what, I live in what Mr. Gold say as the ""Hatred Kingdom"". my review is simply this: Facts are facts and they don't change, Interpretation of these facts is what could change"".First of all, blaming all terrorist actions in the world on this government only is like blaming all dieing animals on the wolf just because we hate wolves more than other prediators. it is really shallow minded and small thinking.Second, I didn't like the way he talk about us as if we came from the planet of apes, generalize that most of us are haters just because a tiny fraction -only 15- of us are terrorists, it is more of stereotyping than analyzing."
0,Politically driven with no real substance,"I've read this book out of curiosity, but unfortunetely found it to be without real or factual substance and no objective conclusion.Rather, it was politically motivated and written by someone who is naturally biased towards Isreal, and could not possibly have the objectivity nor the intention to write the full truth.Saudi Arabia may be a country with many extremists and people who hate America or the west, but we cannot take this view without looking at the big picture and all other factors including Isreal and the Isreali Arab conflict into consideration as well as the Amrican role in Afghanistan, Iraq, and the Middle Eastern regimes that are supported by the United States.Therefore, I can honestly say that this book is worthless, dangerously biased, and incite hatred rather than understanding."
0,Spin and nothing but Spin,"Much of the exhaustive research in this book is outdated, well-known by world governments, involved many of the world governments when the events/transactions were taking place. Reading this books you would think that is some new discovery dug out from the dark pits it was banished to because no one wanted anyone to know about it.... actually no... I have seen, read, and heard countless debates and lectures on this information from world government officials and the like. This is OLD NEWS and very WELL - KNOWN STUFF."
0,Written by a hypocrit with a major agenda,"I read this book and felt overwhelmed with resentment at thewriter and people who share his views.The book was written toinsight hatred and distrust between America and Saudi Arabia,maybe to keep the evangelicals on the march to Israelipromotional conventions.What better way to get the money flowingthen to write a book to engage American emotions and fears.And how interesting it is that Gold's home country never takesresponsibilty for anything it does,and mistakes made.Yeh,aim the blame at someone else while you take more Palestinianland and make their lives a living hell.Then take more from usAmericans while you spread discord between two countries whoneed more understanding rather than your hate driven lies.Also this book does not represent the many conflicting opinionsof his people,the Israelis,not all of them think as he does."
0,AtheistWorld.Com Book Review,"This book leaves out much to be desired.You are better off reading ""Islam Exposed"" by Solomon Tulbure ISBN: 1932303456"
0,"Interesting, but with a heavy bias.","Though this book has many interesting things to say, it greatly worries me how many people are accepting it at face value. Remember who is writing this text, an adivsor, ambassador to the UN and foreign policy advisor for Israel. I'm sure that had someone less biased written an account of Saudi Arabia it would sound very different. Not to mention that many people have quite a few choice things to say about the actions of Israel itself. It is always a good idea to get many points of view, but we must remember that they are only points of view and are colored by circumstances."
0,Zip 750 Unreliable,"I've been a Zip disk fan for many years. However, this 750 drive (firewire) and accompanying disks has been terrible. I just had my third disk go currupt in as many months. All data lost. I'm finding another media for daily backups..."
0,Not as pictured,"The shackles pictured had a left and right cuff, different from each other. The product received had 2 identical shackles conected with a chain which has one cuff pointing upward and the other one downward. I did not mind the cheapness of the product, but I did want it to appear as pictured in the photograph. I gave them away."
0,Insufficient vacabulary,"Not a good source for anyone starting to learn arabic. The arabic exglish translation is insufficient. Also words that are in Quran are not easy to find in this dictonary.however, it might be sufficient for anyone who wants to carry it for quick reference."
0,Just Okay,This book has the information one needs to learn the words but is difficult due to having to flip back and forth to form a sentence. Unlike many of the newer methods of learning a new language. This does make a good reference guide.
0,An absolutely awful dictionary,"I've been studying Arabic pretty intensely for the past 40 weeks: 6 hours a day, 5 days a week. This dictionary is awful to the point of worthlessness. Without giving proper context, the definitions are often wrong or are infrequently used synonyms. By stripping away the underlying root system, it actually harms learning. If you must have an English-Arabic dictionary, get the Oxford, though you're better off just using Google translate. Spend the money and invest the time to learn to use Hans Wehr well but don't bother with this book."
0,Arabic Translation,"I bought this book because I needed a reference for picking names for my Arabian horses. Parts of the book are okay, but most of it is a bit cumbersome to use. Unless you speak pretty fluent Arabic, don't bother."
0,Poor Dictionary,"I am learning to speak Arabic at home. The vast majority of the translations in this dictionary are wrong. Don't waste your money, just save up your money and buy the $110 hardcover al Mawrid. This book is completely useless. I am so disappointed."
0,Not as great as it appears.,"In comparison to other compact Arabic-English dictionaries that I have bought, I, at first, found this book heaven-sent. As a second-year Arabic student, I found the large amounts of vocabulary extremely helpful... that is until I began to check my work with native Arab speakers. A number of words listed in this book are incorrect, and do not match up with their translated meanings. Sometimes the translations are extremely off base, and now that I've become aware of this fact, I use it less and less. It can be very helpful for basic words and for the beginner, but it's important to know that it contains a number of errors."
0,"Ok, but.....","More Navy propoganda! While everyone who saw them will agree that the seawolves were good, they were only playing Cavalry. Just as we always considered the SEALs to be tall ARVNs, we in the AIR Cavalry always considered the Seawolves part of the ARVN air force. They were a defensive/reative force, we in the Army air cavaly were the offensive force. Book doesn't mention that because the seawolves had to operate off of boats, they couldn't carry our ammo load and therefore couldn't stay in the fighting as long as army gunships. If you didn't have to trot along side your gunship on takeoff because it was overweight with ammo, you couldn't expect to stay in the fighting very long. OK, book for those who know nothing about gunships but not so great for those of us who were on them."
0,dissapointed,"I was surprised at the little jar! I guess I didn't read the size when I ordered...anyway- it didnt help at all. I went back to another product that I use that keeps it (rosacea) under control. I had high hopes , but this product couldn't meet them:("
0,Ineffective at best,Ordered the cream and it does nothing to control rosacea. It is ineffective at best or sometimes it seemed it made the condition worse. Disappointed :(
0,Waste of Money.,"I purchased this product and began using it two times daily as directed. I used it for 3 weeks with no improvement in my rosacea.When I tried to return the product to the seller, they refused to take it back because it had been used. I cannot remember how many times I returned lipstick or makeup to a department store with no questions asked.Since then I have purchased and used Skin Medica's product. It is much better quality. Initially it burns a bit when you first start using it bu it quickly goes away, and most important, it works very well in clearing up the rosacea. It's more expensive but well worth it in my opinion."
0,Make my skin flaky and dry,i wouldn't be surprised to find out most of the positive reviews are fake. Used it overnight and when i woke up my skin was dry and flaky where i had put it on. Put it on in the morning and by lunch time i need to use something else as it causes my skin to flake. Won't buy it again and would not recommend it.
0,Chrome Hardware arrived as a Silver One,"""Gibson Les Paul Studio Electric Guitar, Wine Red, Chrome Hardware"" arrived during the Christmas season. Thanks for the timely delivery.BUT, Chrome Hardware has been changed to a Silver one.It is much disappointing that Gibson is deemed losing his reputation by an irresposible sales. The buyers need to be careful when receiving the goods."
0,probably for completists only,"This set captures some of the band's Reading festival performances of 1980/1982. It focuses mainly on thier current material, of the time; so, you won't find a lot of variety or ""classic"" Budgie tracks. The band's performance is just fine, spirited and reasonably tight, but, they suffer from lack of a second guitarist (unlike much of the ""Heavier than Air"" collection), sounding thin much of the time. This problem is worsened by the major lack of low end; Burke's bass is pretty much inaudible without major eqing. All in all, not very satisfying, even for Budgie fans. Try ""Heavier than Air"" for a better retrospective of live Budgie."
0,Ten Minutes Tops,"After spinal surgery I started wearing sturdy shoes. Since I have wide toes and a narrow arch and heel, I thought these gel mats might help with heel comfort. However, after just a few minutes one of the heel mats slid sideways and was very uncomfortable. This ""one-size-fits-all"" did not fit in my shoes."
0,Please remix this CD and REMOVE THE BIRD SOUNDS,"I grew up in the deep South where thunder storms are common. They are soothing and meditative. ""Distant Thunder"" has all the potential of being that way, except for those darn bird sounds. There are no birds in thunderstorms. They are hiding from the rain and are not out chirping their heads off. The rolling thunder in ""Distant Thunder"" is wonderful and transcending, but the bird chirping jolts one out of a blissful state and wreaks havoc upon the expanded Alpha state of the brain. Additionally, when the volume of the thunder is building, the bird chirping gets louder. It is difficult to focus on the calming sounds of thunder when the shrill bird noises over ride the thunder. ""Distant Thunder"" needs to be remixed and have the birds removed totally. Otherwise, it needs to be renamed ""Cacophony of Birds""."
0,very disappointing,I put this on my wishlist and received it as a present.It has NEVER lit up. Not once. Not ever. Planted in full sunlight for over 6 months now. No light. Not once. Not ever.
0,Did not light,"I'm guessing it's a faulty design, because it didn't light up even though we gave it lots of time in the sun."
0,"loud, high-pitched and annoying","I'm a Bernie Krause fan, and was excited for the latest addition to my collection. What a disappointment! Although this has all the environmental realism you expect from a Krause CD, normally they're beautiful and soothing, and this one had roughly the pitch and frequency of a morning alarm clock... well, a bit faster and not as loud unless you crank the volume, but you get the idea--not soothing! More like crickets on crack. After the first painful 30 seconds, I skipped through the rest of the ""East"" sound track at 5-second intervals, but it never let up. The ""West"" soundtrack was a bit better, but still unpleasant. Perhaps if you grew up around these sounds you'll like it (I did, after all, learn to sleep to a chorus of high-pitched, loud frogs croaking in Venezuela, although it took 2 years), but if you're not already in that zone, I'd recommend one of Krause's many other wonderful CDs. Dawn at Trout Lake is good, as are Green Meadow Stream and Sounds of Nature."
0,"Iomega! failed product, terrible support, not willing to help!","Have you ever wonder why they sell all those factory reconditioned stuff?Well, I contacted web support to replace disks, they told me the drive was out of warranty, I explained the drive was perfect, I have unusable media, and that I could send the damaged disks back to them so they could check them, also offered all the serial numbers for all disks.They refused to do anything without a Proof of purchase, and hung me up.Great Support (?), I swear I won't buy anything again from this company.As advise, do the same."
0,wow pad,"Don't care for this type of mouse pad, I thought it would be the padded kind that stay in place. Disapointed and think price is way too high for product."
0,Disappointing and misleading,"Be careful of this book. Hamilton was a great man -- and one much misunderstood in his own time ... and today.McDonald, unfortunately, goes too far in Hamilton's defense. He attempts to paint a picture where Hamilton was responsible for virtually everything that was done right -- and who cautioned against most of the missteps. Everyone else (not just Jefferson!) is painted as incompetent, stupid, conspiring, and selfish.Nor does McDonald at least acknowledge (except in some endnotes) where he departs from the ""conventional"" view point. And, as other reviewers note, there is little discussion of Hamiltons personal life and habits, his family, etc.If you are very familair with the personalities and issues of the time, this book provides an interesting viewpoint and a very good discussion of the banking issues involved.But don't start here."
0,Be warned!!,"Don't read this book if you want to learn about the man that was Hamilton. If your only interest is the politics and financial events of his day then this is the book for you. There is little or no discussion about Hamiltons personal life, his children, his habits, his wife, his education, his thoughts, his friends, even his death and the events arounding it are but a few paragraphs. Look elsewhere to learn about Hamilton."
0,Lack of objectivity overshadows any good points,"The author of this book is so enamored of Hamilton that it completely blinds him to any faults Hamilton may have had. Furthermore, anyone who showed any opposition at all to anything Hamilton proposed is deemed either delusional or a traitor. His treatment of Jefferson and Adams is amazingly disrespectful. Even Washington comes accross as a feeble leader at times without the constant support and advice of his most trusted advisor Hamilton.As the book progresses, the bias gets worse and almost preachy.Shockingly, the famous duel with Aaron Burr gets only about 3 pages worth of description.....probably since it was not exactly a high point in his life.Avoid this book if you want a well-balanced biography."
0,Deplorable Partisan Biography,"Forrest McDonald's ""Alexander Hamilton"" should not be called a biography, but a partisan harangue, and libel on liberty. In this McDonald champions Hamilton, and ambitious,self centered,anti republican Founding Father. McDonald libels Thomas Jefferson, and attempts to degrade his views in the early American Republic by inflating the character of Hamilton. Hamilton, contrary to McDonald's belief was seriously anti-republican. In the Constitutional Convention Hamilton propsed an unlimited government based on the British monarchy. He was distrustful of common people even calling them ""a great beast"". McDonald, like all admirers of Hamilton, attempts to gloss over Hamilton's anti-liberty and repblican ideals and instead elevate him as a defender of them. Hamilton was an avid supporteer of the wealthy's domination of government, and McDonald strongly supports this view.McDonald is not objective in the least, and overall has produced a deplorable partisan biography."
0,No active table of contents,The description of this collection is deceptive.There is no active table of contents.This makes finding individual stories difficult.
0,Just an okay album,"""Attack"", ""The Kill"", ""Was It A Dream?"" ""The Fantasy and even the over played ""From Yesterday"" are the tracks that stick with you. The rest of the album isn't that good. The others are kind of slow and blend in together. I fell asleep while listening to this album."
0,Abominable schlock,"This music is below awful. Jared Leto is the most self-indulgent non-talent to hit the scene in awhile. I don't even think he knows what his emo-cliches mean. Some of the songs are so embarrassing that you have to laugh to break up the uncomfortable experience. I really want to cheer for humanity, but music like this--equipt with pomp and eyeliner--makes me want to give up."
0,Boring....,"This album was very boring, I don't know how this band got famous, it's so boring. Song ""Modern Myth"" was soft and so boring, it songs ""Attack"" and ""From Yesterday"" that I like. Don't get this album! I'll advice you not to get it!"
0,um..no,"Wow what a pathetic excuse for music. Far from good music. I just happen to see them live at an Audioslave concert before Seether. How embarrassing it was for them..they were worse than awful. Regardless, Seether and Audioslave both put an amazing show on that night! Don't waste your money on this...go get a Seether or Audioslave cd instead."
0,Copy protection = no purchase.,"Great album, 4 stars for content, but only 1 star overall and I'd give it a zero if possible for copy protection. Please, for heavens sake, don't buy copy protected CD's like this one that prevent you from exercising your RIGHT to FAIR USE."
0,"No, please, no..","Their debut was spectacular. Why did they have to do this? I don't write reviews, ever, but I loved the spacey alt rock feel of the debut, and this is my chemical romance at its finest. Why? Jared! You have enough money, don't sell out on your music too."
0,DONT BUY>>CONTENT PROTECTED CRAP,You cant even load this cd onto anything on your computer...GODDAMN IT...WE SHOUDL BOYCOTT AND NOT BUY CD's WITH THIS CONTENT PROTECTED CRAP ON IT!!! Other than its a really good cd
0,what's wrong with you people?,"If you can actually explain to me how this band's sound has grown or matured, rather than simply saying that it has, I'd be amazed. Because the sad fact is this music is much more simple, and much less interesting. They've shown no growth whatsoever, quite the opposite. So, I'm not really sure what makes most of these reviewers think this album is better or even as good as the first. Take the first album; remove all the music but the guitar,bass, and drums; cut back the track lengths; dumb down the melodies; and change the lyrics to the same vague emotional crap other bands like Staind have been doing for years; and then you'll have some idea what this new album sounds like. It doesn't really sound like the Used though, which for some reason a lot of negative reviews have said. It just sounds like really boring, generic rock music, the same kind you can find from a myriad of other bands. This definitely does not have the somewhat unique sound of their first release."
0,"Not Terrible, but Far From Good Enough","Sorry, but the band took a couple big steps backwards after a really excellent 1st album.There is nothing to say is great here, so sadly they fell far short of their own standard of greatness. I agree with the reviewers who say it is hard to tell this is the same band. Kind of highschoolish, both in content and in production values.Maybe it was the great producer on the 1st album that made it happen so well, as Leto is so proud to say that their new guy is a peer in age - implying that the producer of Pink Floyd's ""The Wall"" is not really their style or up to their new and improved standard. I start to suspect that maybe it was not the band, but the producer who was the real artist?Hats off to the 1st album, really a landmark work of the decade. Better luck next time."
0,Disappointing...,"I was extremely excited when I found out 30STM was coming out with a new cd. I heard Attack and was like ""ok they tried something new with this one, I like it"". Well unfortunately, this song and The Kill are the only songs I liked. The others just didn't do anything for me. The spacey feel like on songs like ""Echelon"" and ""93 Million Miles"" from the previous album are completely gone, the lyrics are typical mainstream stuff and being a drummer, I was disappointed that the drums were a lot less interesting cool. I was let down by this one, hopefully 30STM can redeem themselves on the next CD and if not, at least we still have the first album to listen to."
0,Bad music,"I was a little disturbed about the reviews here stating that there was a problem with the copy protection on this CD since I like to compile my own CDs, but after listening to this crap I don't care one bit about the copy protection. Just not music I want to listen to a second time. Paid a whole 75 cents for it at a yard sale, and I feel ripped off."
0,Copyright protected CD,I checked this album out from my local library to see if it was worth buying. I found out rather quickly that this not an ordinary audio CD but a copy protected album. It will not play or copy. This being said I will not be buying this album. Don't buy this album or you'll be throwing your money down the drain.
0,Protected CD - DO NOT BUY,Consumers should know that this CD is a DRM protected CD and will not be able to be read in most computer CD-ROM drives along with certain regular audio CD players. I recently purchased this CD only to find out that I could only use it in the car and an old CD player I happened to still have.Like most people I usually rip my CD's to MP3s and do the majority of listening either at my computer or on the go with my MP3 player. This isn't even a remote possibility. Do not support companies and bands that restrict consumer's rights!This is a Virgin Records CD.
0,It won't play,"Like so many other customers, I've found this CD will not play on my computer, even though I have a brand-new Gateway running Windows XP and the newest version of Windows Media Player.This is atrocious. This sort of copy protection needs to stop. Because I bought the CD used, I can't take it back to a store. Don't make the same mistake I did.:-(f*** copy protectionpeace"
0,Beautiful Lie (30STM),"After receiving the initial order, there was a problem with one of the tracks. I contacted Amazon customer service and was quickly told a replacement would be sent. Which was also defective. They notified me that the problem was wide spread and once I sent both back, I had no problems getting my refund. I can honestly say they have given me excellent and quick customer service. I plan to continue to shop at [...]."
0,Good...but not that good.,"Obviously when a band releases their sophmore album people immediately compare it to the first one. I will do that in a minute. In situations like these, I try and hear the new album as independant so I don't develop a biased opinion. This album is good, but it is nothing too special. It has a hint of progressive rock that is overshadowed more by its ""mainstreamish"" pop sound; WHEREAS the first album had a more futuristic, original sound. I honestly liked the band better on that album, even though it wasn't really a ""band"" persay. This album just lacks the originality I like to hear and has been robbed of the credibility on the s/t release. I'd say it is above Fall Out Boy, but way below Tool on terms of originality. And I am in no way literally comparing these bands so I don't want to hear anyone bitching, but 30STM would be closer to Fall Out Boy on the spectrum than Tool."
0,Don't Bother!,"I should have listened to all the song samples before buying this CD! This groups style needs alot of work, between the wimpery-whinney serinading and heavy metal screaching my head hurts. I haven't been victim to listening to music this bad since my mother's only remedy for depression was blasting Niel Diamond for 3 hours every night. There should be a refund for music this terribleA Beautiful Lie!"
0,If it doesn't broke why did you fixed it???!!!!!!!!,"How come the best band in the world make such a lame record?!i think they hang out too much with The Used so they tought ""why not make an album that all the dum people in the world would like and we will have more fans""Every song on this CD is just avarage crap."
0,30 Seconds to Disappointment,"Listening to the first song for a few moments, I already knew that this album was not going to be like their first. ""A Beautiful Lie"" has a few good moments, but most of it isn't as explosive or captivating as their first. There is a lot of screaming, but there doesn't seem to be a lot of feeling behind it. The songs are pretty slow-paced.What this album seems to be is a failed attempt at recreating the power and sound of the self-titled album, only adding more feelings and emotions (notice the roses all over the album art?).The CD doesn't seem to work with Windows Media Player on my computer. Also, the copy protection allows you to copy or burn the album a maximum of three times, apparantly.This album is largely boring and nothing special. I hate to say it. The bonus tracks, however, are pretty good."
0,CD will not play after PC upgrade,"Bought the CD when it first came out and it can only be played from the embedded player on the CD. It says you can copy into your library but it was very tricky. Upgraded my computer and now the CD is not supported and will not play at all. I am very unhappy with this because now I have to buy the album all over again in a new format. The CD has now become a coaster. Other than that, the album is great with awesome songs. Wish I could listen to it more."
0,Copy Protected,"This is a ""copy protected"" CD which means it is not actually a ""Compact Disc"" (look closely and you won't find the CD logo anywhere on the packaging) and does not conform to the spec. It's very likely that you will not be able to get this onto your iPod or other player. If you're like me, that makes this disc (remember, it's not a CD) useless since I don't even own a normal CD player. Don't give these guys any of your hard-earned money. Find another way to hear this music or find an artist that actually cares about their fans."
0,Won't Play,"This CD is copy protected, and won't play in any of my CD players, nor my DVD player. The copy protection is supposed to allow you to play it on your PC as well, however that does not work on either my XP or my Win2000 PC. I'd like to give a review of the music IF I COULD EVER LISTEN TO IT. Do not buy this CD and support this horrid attempt at limiting my free use of the music I buy."
0,Not Happy,"Item received, although very nice looking, was very different looking from what was shown on Amazon. I ordered it twice thinking the first one received was a mistake, but the second looked the same. I also ordered a side splash to match which was the same as shown, so different than the sink tops. Items could not be used as they did not match and I was charged a 20% restocking fee for returning the side splash. Very disappointed."
0,Boring!,"I listened to this twice & was bored to tears. Too many instrumentals that all sound the same. The good news is I won't have to listen to it again because it found its way into the circular file, a first for me."
0,A Waste of My Hard Earned Money,"This Corona Clipper AC 8300 Sharpening Tool will ruin nearly every blade you apply it to.When given the choice I allows chose to buy Corona tools all my life. They are good quality tools. But this sharpener has no control to it. The carbide is extremely sharp and will remove material from just about any tool you have. The problem is the small amount of surface area in contact with the edge being sharpend. This allows for gouging to occur even with the slightest pressure. I ruined two pairs of scissors and had to spend an hour with my honing stones to repair the edge on my pruner.Corona should be ashamed to place their name on this tool. The only reason I can see for doing so, is that their competitors sell the same style sharpener. So, Corona is just trying to get you to spend that little bit extra of your hard earned money. Save your cash and stick with your honing stones."
0,Your better off using the sidewalk,"Corona is for betty homemakers. I wouldn't sharpen a crayon with this. There are three ways to sharpen things properly. #1 a high speed grinding wheel (you better know exactly what your doing), #2 a sharpening stone, #3 any Japanese or German sharpening product.this flimsy little thing will turn your thumb into a lacerated pool of hell."
0,It works but then its shot after a season,This sharpener works fairly well but wears out very quickly. Mine is shot after 2 months and thats with using both sides.I would not recommend this product since its a throw away sharpener.
0,Corona guarantee is no good,Corona tools are great until they break and you try to get a replacement as their guarantee says. They just tell you it is not our tool that it is a knock off. So much for their lifetime guarantee!

0,"3 strikes, they're out.","returned the first 2 that malfunctioned, only to get a third one that also malfuctions.Piece of junk. Save your money!"
0,like tepid water....,"The impulsive governess left me extemely disatisfied. In fact, I lost my enthusiasm as early as the few few pages when I discoverd that the author was fond of head hopping. Furthermore, the predictable plot, and characters that were much too tame(or just underdeveloped), made it impossible for me to enjoy this book. Lord Forestale especially, acted more like a green 19 year old than the grown man he was meant to be, and absolutly nothing like a man sharp enough to be entrusted with couriering important documents for the country at wartime.Sorry to say, i will be giving Barbara Allister's books a miss in the future.Oh, and also, the blurb on the back cover of the book is totally misleading. Deveraux could in no way be refered to as a man with ""an iron will and molten temper""!"
0,wrestling with spirituality,"Just finished the book. I've read everything he's ever written. The last few have seemed to struggle..He's such an effective story teller. I love the situations he creates, but he always falls apart somewhere around the end. I was riveted to this book. Hooked from page one. By the end of the third section I was angry, cause I knew he'd drop off again...On the inside cover of the book it describes this as people 'Wrestling with their spirituality'. He should figure out his spirituality before it ruins his career as a writer. Too much on the God thing. If your a Coupland fan, you may want to reconsider rushing out and buying this, simply because it has his name on it. Hey Doug! Relax!...Get confession out of the way, and come on back to the group!"
0,I DID NOT LIKE IT,"THis book kinda sucked. It went on and on and on and on and didn't really have much of a point except to say that mass killing of teenagers ruins a lot of lives which isn't exactly a big epiphany though. I found Cheryl to be a big phony, Jason was depressed yet extremely self-centred, and Heather was just a very insecure person who needed intensive therapy to help her see that she deserved to be treated well and shouldn't stay with people who can't possibly meet her needs.THis was just a book about a bunch of messed up people who continue to mess up their lives and then mess up the lives of everyone around them.It had tragic overtones, obviously, just mostly I thought it was just pathetic.I did NOT like it! Coupland could write better than this!!!"
0,I surprised myself by finishing reading the book,"This was not an enjoyable read, apart from the first hundred or so pages which provided an interesting perspective on England during the industrial revolution. Apart from that it is a painful history (how accurate I do not know) of the Mormon church and contains disturbing perspectives on its founders. To me this book really inspired a negative view of the Mormons, Joe Smith, Brigham Young & Co and of their bigamy/polygamy. Whether this was the intention of our LDS author I do not know.In short, don't bother reading this book."
0,Horrible! Not an uplifting book!,"I found Saints to be a poor sampling of LDS fiction. The first half of the book tells the story how Dinah Kirkman grew up in England and is VERY depressing. I continued to read the book with the hope that it would get better. It didn't! The story continues with Dinah's polygamous marriage to Joseph Smith then latter to Brigham Young. The story takes a very harsh view of Emma Smith. The intimate relationships were too graphically described. This book, though maybe well written, is not historically accurate and has blatant historical flaws. It is a depressing book, with no redeeming factors. Don't waste your time on it!"
0,I did not feel proud of my heritage after reading this one!,I thought I was reading a Harlequin romance novel based on Mormon polygamy love affairs. I do not beleive OSC gave Joseph Smith the respect that a prophet deserves. The book left a bad taste in my mouth.
0,please don't bother,"This is a book about being a mormon. It is skillfully written, but a bible story not scifi or interesting fiction. If you are a mormon...you will love this book. If not, buy treasure box or some other of his books"
0,Ready to Convert,"It wasn't my favorite Orson Scott Card novel but after reading this fanciful, glossed-over version about the origins of one of Christianity's most successful, bizarre and ridiculous cults, I was almost convinced that polygamy was godly and that Native Americans were lost Israelis.Better works by Card: Wyrms, Worthing Saga, Pastwatch...He still earns stars because the man can narrate a story..."
1,Adventures of Huckleberry Finn,"I can hardly believe that at age 77 I had never read this one of Mark Twain's classics. I found it to be interesting and hard to lay down. I understand the opposition by the politically correct crowd, but one must understand when it was written -a time when the N word was not necessarily used in a derisive way - then one can enjoy the work of literature. Thanks for making it available for Kendle."
1,Huckleberry,The good thing is that they found that gold and now their are rich.Now Huckleberry is a good dude .the end
1,A Classic,What can you really say about a classic? It is exactly what I expected. You just can't get a better story teller than Mark Twain.
1,no more bulky books to carry around,Love my tablet. When I do read I like them in one place on my tablet. The last book I had someone stole it.
1,Huck Finn review,A great heart warming adventure novel that not only tells the life of a young boy but criticises the flaws of socioty
1,"The Good, Bad, and the Ugly","Huckleberry Finn was a great literary work published in 1885 and written by Mark Twain. One of the most positive things about the book would be that the reading level is not very advanced and that it shows us a glimpse of the past. Along with the reading level not being very advanced, the book itself is extremely well thought out, and brings the stories, characters, and imagery to life. One of the negatives is the amount of cursing that takes place throughout the book. This is a negative because it is at a children's reading level and it does not add any literary value to the book as a piece of history. The ugly but I believe necessary part of the book is the use of the n-word. This is a necessary part of the book because it shows to our children and everyone the meaning behind the word. If anything it makes the reader more understanding of the troubles that the slaves when though and understand the meaning of the word a little more deeply."
1,What was I thinking for so long?!,"Can't believe it took me so long to get around to reading this book, because it's fantastic, and one of the best summer reads. It's very deep - exploring the old American west (now known as the American south, along the Mississipi River valley), and the people, places, and goings-ons, through the brave eyes of a young (essentially) innocent - while being just plain fun. It is dated, but that's part of its charm - the language is rustic, the children are freer, the people more trustworthy, and the river was a little wider, the heat a little hotter. A real piece of old Americana."
1,A great novel from America,"""Adventures of Huckleberry Finn"" is considered by many to be the great American novel.Samuel Clemens was a shrewd, humorous, and cynical author. That is what I like about him.I will not go into the literary qualities of this piece. It has been handled before. This review is about this edition 9780679448891 Random House l996, First Edition.This publication attempts to be ""The only comprehensive edition,"" including, of course, the raft chapter and using extant manuscripts to publish the work as close to the author's final vision as possible.The introduction and addendum are informative and photos of some of the original manuscript pages are insightful, leaving me to wonder how the typesetters ever completed their work.Best of all, this book has a good feel to it. Unlike a paperback or a screen, this edition feels right in my hands and is a joy to read. I even like the illustrations."
1,Huck Finn,"A great classic, this is the story of Huck Finn and his adventures rafting down the Mississippi with Jim, a runaway slave. Although I enjoyed it this go around, I enjoyed it more as a teenager when I read it the first time. Overall, if you haven't read it, you should!"
1,Great book on CBD,Great story and a good reader of the book. I enjoy Mark Twain and this one is one of the best
1,good book...........................,"This is a very good book, because it had show you what happen can a kid be, and it told you how evil and lovely in ths world."
1,For all kids at heart,"This was the first classic I read. Wow, have I come a long way!!!!! Adventure is the most obvious theme of this novel, which in return leads to self-discovery. Hucks average day consists of danger, trouble, and a few screams but never intentionally only because his natural boyish interest always seems to lead him to dirty water. With trials and tribulations, something Huck finds plenty of on his great journey, comes growth. At the end of the novel, Huck goes from overlooked to the looked up to kid. All kids, and kids at heart should read this novel."
1,great novel,gret novel awesome thing I love this story caus eit was free never finished it though never read the first page actually
1,Huck Finn Review,"This book was delivered quickly, and in said condition. This Barnes and Noble classic is a great version of the timeless Mark Twain novel. Twas a great purchase!"
1,Huckleberry Finn,"""The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn"" by Mark Twain is an absolute must read. Twain masterfully creates an interesting story line while staying true to the times, setting, and language. Huck's tale of his adventure down the Mississippi will keep you turning the pages. It is very interesting because things happen when you least expect it. This is an amazing story full of adventure and fun.But of course, you will find the character's speech to be either annoying or downright confusing. But remember, this takes place in the past! It was normal for people to talk like that. So try your best to translate the character's speech. All in all, this book is an unforgettable and amazingly adventurous. When I read this book,(I thought)it should be in the top 5-50 best classic of all time.by Pra"
1,The race card.,"It seems that everybody's initial reaction after reading Huck Finn is to debate if Twain was a racist or not. It's a pity because such a debate takes away from the greatness of the book. Was he a racist? I don't know, I never met the man. History and his own writing would seem to support that he was. Do I think any less of him, despite my opinion that he might have been racist? Not in the least. His racism was born out of a time when racism was the norm and rooted more in fear and culture rather than hate. Perhaps ignorance would be a better term, but I dare not call this man ignorant. I really don't think he was a mean hearted man, but being nice doesn't exclude one for being a racist. Read the book, you may form a different opinion."
1,your eyes get stuck,"For my junior year in High School we had to read Huckleberry Finn over the thanksgiving vacation. This book is wonderful despite the confusing language, which only makes it better. Granted that I had read it many years before and knew it was good but I couldn't put it down. I read every chance I got and finished it realy early. It is a riviting story about Huck and his adventures just trying to get away from civilization and in whick he constantly runs up against it. It's loads of fun for everyone"
1,Audiobook last 1/3 is re-written,I am a very big fan of Mark Twain and Garrison Keillor but was suprised to learn that the last 1/3 of this American Classic was re=written. Keillor uses his own style and craft to appeal to the listener. I found this audiobook entertaining but I wish I had known it was not the original story I have read 4 times since childhood.
1,Adventures of Huckleberry Finn,"My youngest daughter is an avid reader and loves re-reading books she was assigned in English class. In fact, she is a collector of these required assigned readings such as Mark Twain books."
1,correction,"Whoever wrote the review titled ""where theres a will theres a way"" got a couple of things wrong in his review of the book The Adventures of Tom Sawyer.First of all the book doesnt say that Tom was really close to his aunt Polly.He cares for her but usually doesnt show it. And it was not Tom`s friend Joe that they found dead in the cave,it was Injun Joe ""that murderin` half breed""."
1,John's opinion,"Mark Twain's tale is timless. As a friend remarked, Huckleberry Finn is all things good. Tom Sawyer could grow up to be Donald Trump. John Seelye's introduction is insufferable. If Twain had been exposed to it, Seelye would have joined his hate list. Without the introduction, The book would have received the five stars it deserves."
1,I know why this book is a classic...,"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn is a GREAT novel by Mark Twain. It's about a boy, ""Huck"" living in the deep south in the 1800's during the time of slavery. Huck does not fit into the life that is aunt or father or anyone else imagines for him. Instead, he lives a life based upon his everyday adventures. During some parts of this book, I was so excited, I couldn't put it down. During some other parts, I just wanted to fall asleep. The slow parts do pass by quickly and the book is worth your time. This book does contain some politically-incorrect language, but I still highly recommend it."
1,Great Classic,"This is a great book and deserves the place it has as a literary classic. The audio version was very good with the narrator using very different voices for the various characters so there is no confusion about who is speaking - a weakness with less talented narrators. The reason that I gave this product 4 and not 5 stars was the packaging - which I found to be inadequate - the case is cardboard and each CD comes in a paper envelope - not good for storage over the years, especially if it is used on a consistent basis by multiple persons. But the actual narration was first class and brought the well known book to life."
1,Huck Finn,"The moment when Huck chooses to help Jim to freedom Americans going to Hell in doing what he considers a bad deed is truly touching and shows a natural development of character. Moreover, life on the Mississippi was a genius dramatization for Twain. Very enjoyable"
1,The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn,This was a great product. The price was good and it was shipped quickly. I recomend this product. My eleven year old son enjoys this book and has learned a lot of history.
1,The greatest American novel,"I don't need to tell you what this book is about: everyone is familiar with it. I started reading it for the first time at age 25, fully expecting it to be the greatest novel I've ever read. I was not disappointed. I've never laughed so much with one book. The dialects, the events, the people: they're all so priceless. A masterpiece!"
1,A good buy,This was the least expensive of the available editions. It was excellent as the print was large making it easy to read.It is a classic book and was well presented.
1,Huckleberry Finn,this is a classic book that should be read by everyone. it shows the brilliant side of Mark Twain.the description is so vivid and the adventures take you away to a different world.
1,Boys and their adventures,"Twain's classic story about being a boy and having adventures is as relevant today as in Huck's time. We actually experience Huck's activities through his eyes, with his thoughts and the reasoning behind his actions. Twain captures perfectly the thought process of a (13 year old?) young man. Yes, it takes place during slavery period, and, though some of the language may be objectionable by today's standards, it is a story worth reading and enjoying. There is a lot more than what is ever shown in any of the movies made from this book."
1,An American Classic,"To everyone who said this book was simply a children's story--you obviously don't understand this book. It is a brilliant satire about slavery and about the conventions of society. When I first read this book I didn't quite understand it either and just blew it off as another tedious book we had to read for school. But after reading it and discussing it in AP English, I discovered just how brilliant it was. Huck is caught in an eternal struggle between doing what society tells him is right and doing what he feels in his heart. It's a classic Pikaresque type novel, and a funny one at that. A lot of it's humor is in it's irony. And it pokes fun at religion, war (mobs), slavery, and society in general. I suggest those of you who disliked it should read it again. It is a truly great novel."
1,I'm Confused!,Although Huckleberry Finn was an AWSOME book the little details were really really hard to follow. I read the same part like three times and i still didnt get it. Once you start to understand it a little bit better then it gets way better. I also loved the whole conflict in the story. It really makes you think :} Also it is kind of funny ( at times) Overall Huckleberry Finn has a good Plot and good moral but if you dont pay attention you will be left in the dark :{
1,Trouble maker Finn,The story of Huck Finn starts with him living with a widow as a foster parent becuase his dad is gone and his mom is dead.The widow is raising him as a respectable boy but his dad shows up one day and kidnaps him. They go and live in a cabin in the woods. His dad is an abusive alcoholic and one day his dad threatens to kill him. So one night Huck fakes his own death and hides on an island in the mississippi river. While he's there he meets a runaway black man... and heads down the river. About half way down the river they meet 2 men or con artists. They continue down the river encountering many adventures.I thought this was a good book and I'm a person that does not like to read.If you can read this book you should.
1,Huck Finn-LSMS,I liked this book because it was about a kid my age doing things that sounded cool. There was a mix of comedy & adventure. It showed what life was like back then. Plus Huck is a teenage kid that is a little like me. He doesn't want any worries or responsibilities. However he did care for his friends.
1,Book is great!,"The book is complete and well-formatted. The best part is that it is free! What more can you ask?If you have not read this book, do yourself a favor and do it! A classic in every sense of the word."
1,A boy of many different adventures.,"This book is a good book if you like adventures. Once he has an adventure it gets more interesting and then when it ends. All of a sudden there is another one. Huck has many adventures while trying to free a slave that belongs to his adopted parent. While on his adventures with Jim, the slave, he runs into many dangers and sometimes he comes really close to getting caught. This book is fun and exciting to read and once you start reading it, you want to keep reading."
1,What an amazing novel!,"I am studying this novel at GCSE, and i find it the most absorbing novel that i have read in a very long time."
1,Great!,"This Kindle version of Huckleberry Finn is great. It is not abridged, which is excellent, as it retains all of Mark Twain's original writing. If you wish, you can navigate using individual chapters. Very successful Kindle version. (And if you've never read this before, it's a really wonderful story.)"
1,Huckleberry Finn,Awesome. Classic that will always be a classic! I wished I had read it when I was younger. The friendship between Huck and Tom is so genuine.
1,One of the best classics ever!,"I am a sixteen year old girl and I say that Huck is one of the best boys I have ever met.He stands with his friend Jim even when it seems everyone else is against him.Huck goes against tradition but he doesnt care as long as Jim can make it to freedom. I love this book.The slang was hilarious!Twain created a true American classic.A tale of courage, friendship, taking chances and sticking to what you know is right regardless, this book is all of that with the right amount of humor.Read this book and get ready for the adventure of your life- American style."
1,Classic work,"This book arrived in perfect condition and on time. It is the classic work from Mark Twain, not the politically correct version."
1,Classics Rule!,"Clearly, the classics rule, and this is no exception. I like the kindle version for this, and what's best is that it was free!"
1,Good book for price,This book is a great buy for the price. Nice colorful hardcover design and smaller size is perfect for a child's room. Definitely recommend the Puffin classics!
1,The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn,"dventures of Huckleberry Finn By Mark Twain 352 PagesThis book was very well-writen. It is about a boy named Huckleberry Finn (Huck for short), who runs away with his slave named Jim, who doesn't speak English very well. They run into a lot of trouble along the way which makes the book very exciting and suspenseful. Like one time they run into a bunch of pirates. That part kept me turning the pages. I think that the setting makes the story more exciting and it is an important part of the story. The setting is a very long time ago, when slaves were still legal. At times the book can be confusing, but it is worth it, because Mark Twain is a great author."
1,A wonderful book,"This is a coming of age story of a thirteen to fourteen year old boy named Huckleberry Finn, who tries to help a runaway slave named Jim escape. The book also has a lot of funny stuff in it. For example Mark Twain makes fun of civilization by showing how stupid the people in town are, and how street-smart Huck is. This book also has an anti-slavery message."
1,Bad Ending,"This is a story filled with action and adventure. I loved the plot and the characters, even if I didn't always agree with their actions. My two complaints: The ending-pointless!!, The amount of cusing- I found the vernacular disturbing, even if it is true to the era."
1,Great adventure/drama,I think the book was very exciting and I would tell any of my friends to read this book. I think that Mark Twain is a brillant novelist and he will never be replaced.
1,Blast from the past,"I read this book a long time ago and forgot most of it. It is a fun read, and I enjoyed it very much."
1,Classic,"Huckleberry Finn is a classic! How could you possibly go wrong? There are a couple of instances throughout the text where I've questioned the narrator's ability to know/not know certain things (such as the exact time in the middle of the night at one point while traveling down the river, to his inability to do the same later in the book), but regardless...it's a classic!!"
1,Classic Everyone Must Read,"I can still vividly remember my mom reading it to my brother and I. I loved it. Rereading it to my daughters, it seemed to drag a bit in parts in a way I didn't remember, but still a good read that at times is sparkling. Everyone needs to read it, as it's an American lit touchstone."
1,A forced read...but ag reat one,"A set text in Yr 11 English, this book has become a favourite of mine. A grand adventure, with some great observations of society -- and people in general."
1,Thought provoking,"Lots to think about, I liked it, but sometimes it was hard to get the meaning behind which was the better parts. Interesting to see how life was, if you didn't grow up being taught that way. Makes you watch what is being taught to you and not to believe everything. Society can be wrong, life is a mixture of grays not black and white."
1,The times and trials of Huck Finn.,"This book has been reviewed to death: I will only echo Hemingway's criticism that the final few chapters of the story are a bit disappointing. Other than this, it is a wonderful depiction of life in the 1830's Mississippi. A great read!"
1,Fun book I like it good buy,This is a good book recommended can be weird at times but I luv it before this get Tom sawyer because that is the first one
1,Huck Finn,"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn, by Mark Twain, reflects the development and maturity of a young man during early America. This novel includes many morals which the main character, Huck, comes across. He is an adventurous boy who has to make many adult decisions and had many pressures. Huck is being forced to be civilized by the Widow Douglas while his best friend Tom Sawyer encourages him to rebel and have a good time. All the while, Huck's drunk, abusive father stumbles back into the picture trying to use his son. The novel can be related to many different issues seen in society today such as individualism and racial problems. Narrated through Huck's eyes and literally in his own words, the book is written in a way to be enjoyed by a variety of readers. It was interesting to see a young boy escape on his own and befriend a runaway slave, defying the social norms. His attitude and freewill make him a very relatable character. This book would come highly recommended."
1,The advenger of Huckleberry Finn,Huckleberry Finn was a story about a boy who was an orfan. He lived with a widow and his father was not very nice to him .One day he snuck out of his house and ran away andfound a firend. I thought this was a good book.

1,Jeff Watts Review,I thought the book expressed rasism and reality about the world as it was during their time. These issues were a concern to Jim and Huck but in actualality Huck never realized that Jim was being treated unfairly. This lets us learn that racism cannot go on and that it needs to change during our time. That is why the Adventures of Huckleberry Finn was an outstanding novel for kids to read.
1,Thank you!,The book arrived in the condition described prior to purchase. It was delivered earlier than expected and is a very useful addition to my collection of primary sources. Thank you!
1,My dad's favorite remote control.,"My 95-year-old dad has eyesight loss. Having great difficulty reading, he watches far more TV than he used to. He likes this remote better than any other (and we're tried quite a few) because it doesn't have too many buttons, the buttons are big and the controls for volume and channel up and down are very easy to work by touch. Very intuitively designed. And it's not overly large and unwieldly like some of the other big button remotes. As with most universal remotes, when the batteries occasionally do run out (battery life on this remote is good), the unit needs to be reprogrammed for the TV. Because my dad can't reprogram by himself, he keeps two of this model of remote -- one loaded up as a spare in case batteries run out on the other."
1,Good choice,"the quality of the image and the sound is poor but we are not here because of tht, the competition is good enough and you can see an amazing display of ground game, good purchase if you are into the sport"
1,Sweet sounds,"At this point in time, I doubt that there are many people on the planet who don't know at least one song by this guy...There's not much to say -- it's a CD. No quality issues related to the physical product."
1,"If you learn by demonstration, this is a great spindle video","If you always wanted to learn how to add turning to your furniture project and you learn best by seeing an expert do it (slowly), this is for you. A great supplement to the book by the same title. END"
1,Favorite cookbook,"I have just recently started using a toaster oven and I am thrilled with this little ""manual."". I would never have even thought to use it for most of the items Ms. Dewitt includes. Every recipe I have tried has received rave reviews from my family. A must have if you want to get the most out of your toaster oven."
1,What a great themed cookbook.,As I have been reading though this cookbook I am already marking pages and planning what I'll be making with this and my brand new taoster oven.
1,great recipes,"I have found this book to have tremendous recipes, and most are low fat. Everything I have tried works to perfection. My only complaint, is the pan sizes are not real. Like many recipes call for an 81/2x81/2x4 one quart dish. There is no such dish."
1,the best place to start.....,"Obviously commedia dell'arte is a live theatre form, and obviously you know a bit about commedia otherwise you wouldn't be reading this review. As far as any book can help anyone do live theatre, especially a form so comic and forceful, then ths book can. Nowhere it loses sight of the fact that its job is to encourage people to action and performance and then begin to discover for themselves.It is not an esoteric bible of secret facts which will allow anyone to become a commedia performer.It is an actor's manual and, if you cannot find adequate live teaching of the form, it is one of the best books you can find to start with."
1,Very Useful Book - The Bible of Commedia dell'Arte,"This is a very useful book. I am a teacher of Commedia dell'Arte and use it regularly with my classes. It has a good balance of history, theory and practical information. This truly is the definitive guide to Commedia dell'Arte."
1,Success,This book is a master piece. It explains everything in detail of how to step into to the characters etc.Success
1,not The Second Season but still good,"this is not the second season this is only episode 24-51 T,T even though this show is really awesome i wish they dubbed the real season 2 (episode 51-102):( gaaaaaaaaaaaaah Dx akito just sounds so weird in Japanese D:"
1,Kodocha=laughter and love,"Kodocha is one of those series' that warms your heart and nearly makes you pee your pants laughing. It is very random at times and very very energetic. while being upbeat it also has a serious atmosphere at times. Overall it is about sana a child star and her relationships with family,co-actors,friends and love interests. However with Sana around life is anything but dull, if you like typical school day dramas with added comedy,love triangles and pure randomness than Kodocha is just what your looking for."
1,Engaging Introduction to Saints and Blesseds,"I would actually rate this book 4.5 stars if Amazon had that option. The reason I can't give it 5 stars is that the author does not use proper capitalization when using pronouns referring to God (i.e. ""his"" when it should be ""His""). Also, there is some other ungrammatical language that is clearly a deliberate attempt to appeal to modern kids but that really bothers me. I know Ms. Welborn can write proper English, and as a home educator that's what I expect in the books aimed at impressionable young minds.The stories are very engaging, and there is a good mix of familiar and unfamiliar saints and blesseds from throughout the ages. I like the organization by theme- ""saints are people who...(love children, teach us new ways to pray, help the poor and sick, change their lives for God, etc.)"" The author does a good job presenting the stories in an age-appropriate manner, which is always a concern given the violence many of the saints had to endure."
1,Great book for children and adults,"This is my 8 year old son's favorite book! I have learned a lot from it as well! The book is chalk-full of 3-4 page stories about saints from all times. The stories are framed with an introduction that kids can relate to from their own lives and concluded with a short question to expand discussion between children and parents about how the saint's virtues can relate to the child's life. The saint stories are engaging, insightful, and well written with children in mind. This book is the best resource I have found for expanding a child's knowledge of the Catholic religion as well as his or her character virtues."
1,Santa Spoiler Alert,"I just wanted to add a note that the very first saint in the book is St. Nicholas, and the revelations provided could spoil the fun of Christmas morning for some families."
1,Loyola Saint Book,"I was quite pleased with the book and the price, it did just what I needed it to do, interest my young grandson in the Saints"
1,Cool book!,Very cool book! My kids love it! Step Into Reading books are great for each level of reading that your kids can grow into bigger books.
1,You Go Girl!,"I have read this book at least 50 times if not more. I'm not a real book readed but this book grap my attention and did not let go until I was finish reading the last sentence. The day that I got my copy I had read it three times. I just could not put the book down,I must say that this indeed is the best book I have ever read. Ms.Monica just related to every women struggle and what we as women had to put up with from these tired men that are out here. I felt that she was living my life because everything she was going though I had been though. I can't wait for the next book from this author I think she can become a Bestselling author in fact ""Bad By Myself"" and Ms.Pashonia S.Robinson is on my Bestseller list at Number 1."
1,"A good, short tale!","I thought that I have read it all. Leeping over fire hydriants in a single bound is defeinetly a new one. This book was a good, short, and very-funny read. I read it in one day and enjoyed every word of it."
1,"Ms. Monica is outspoken, funny, and too much for me!!","I had the opportunity to read a promotional copy of the book and Ms. Thing is definetely on way. Although it is a rather thin book, the story line keeps your eyes glued to the pages. I thought about putting an ad in a paper once to get a date, but I didn't have the guts to go through with it and according to Ms. Monica, I'm glad I didn't. All-in-all, I think the story line is original and her attitude is just too funny. I really enjoyed reading it!!"
1,The new 'Betty Crocker',"Don't be insulted or missled. This is the new age book for a cook begining to cook at home. It covers everything you need to know to prepare and serve delicious foods that almost anyone would enjoy. The emphasis is on 'how to' followed by what to cook.It starts at the begining, what pots, tools, and techniques you must have on hand to start to enjoy cooking. It is first rate for that person!I thouroughly enjoyed this book, but if you are an accomplished home chef, pass it by.DOC"
1,Required reading for anybody with a kitchen,"Well organized, straight forward information about preparing everything from soup to nuts...literally. The instructions and photographs are detailed, yet not overly complex, and the recipes and variations allow you to refine your skills at your own pace.This book lays a perfect foundation on which to build an impressive repertoire of culinary skills."
1,You will be glad you read it!,"Everyone else is right, this book is truly a blessing. It is informative and intellectual while being deeply spiritual and inspirational. Truly absorbing the contents of this book will no doubt strengthen your faith. If you are Catholic it is a must, it explains a great deal and inspires. This is coming from a 24 year woman living in the 'real' world. Give it a try!"
1,Very well told story of Rama,"I have read Ramayana a million times.There are a lot of versions like Valmiki,Tulsidas & Kamban are the most famous ones.Here the author Vanamali has told Valmiki's version in her own style which totally touches your heart.Though I have a lot of books on Ramayana,this has become my all time favourite."
1,Welcome to the golden cage...,"World War Three is over. Nuclear weapons were not used, but just about everything else was. Old nations have died out and new powers have replaced them. A nomad soldier, Deunan Knute, and her cyborg partner, Briareos, have been taken from the ruins, out of the wastes, to utopia. A utopia called Olympus, the central city of the new Earth.Yet, even utopia has power struggles. Will mankind be changed and became something better IF nonhuman or embrace total peace at the cost of his spirit? Or will it all be destroyed again by uncontrolled emotions such as hate and greed?Or will mankind be able to find a way, a path that combines it all? Shirow is the best artist to help us ask the question and maybe the only one who can help us answer it."
1,More - just squish me with more of this stuff!!!!!!,"Here is volume three of Shirows ""life's work"". Our heroes must continue to fight against biological enemies and find their place in Olympus. Peace is not easy to achieve amd more gruelingly difficult to maintain when the outside world sees paradise as a threat to humanity, and the real humans of the city aren't always happy. ""We are like birds that live in cages""."
1,Is Simplicity Really This Simple?,"Richard Rohr dives below the surface of rational Western culture in a dialog about God's Kingdom, being poor, social justice and living in a deeper place of simplicity where we are at home with the Jesus in us. The thoughts in this book are profound, simple, and challenging. This book truly captivated me. I did not want to put it down. My mind was stretched and my heart defibrillated as I began to see how simple it all really is... Blessed are those with very little... Blessed are those who have lost something... Blessed are those... Is the Sermon on the Mount just imagery of a life which is unobtainable to us now? His Kingdom seems to be up-side-down. And as Jesus said, ""The Kingdom is here now!"""
1,Incredibly great!,"This book is really funny. It tells about a girl who has to deal with the stuff girls deal with. u know guys, friends, and again guys. Its a really awesome book! Read it. I promise u won't b disapointed!"
1,The Best Book I've Ever Read,"I thought that this book was a great book. Some of my likes were that she always had a different point of view on everything. Another like about this book was that she seems so real, as if she was a real live human being. You never know she could be real or just an image in a lot of people's heads. Some of my dislikes were that she used her own different language and I know a lot of people tend to speak in there own languages. Her's was very confusing until you get to the end of the book where it gives the definition of all of her different words."
1,Review for Georgia,This book is extremeley funny and gives you an overview of a real teenage girls love life; the ups and downs. I loved this book and I can't wait to read the next one.
1,Laugh out loud sequal!,"Georgia is a 14 year old who is on summer break from school. This is the 2nd in a series that follows Georgia's trials and tribulations. Georgia was kissed by the man of her dreams Robbie aka. Sex God at the end of the last book. Now just as her dreams are answered she is going to have to go to New Zealand to see her father, unless she can figure out how to get out of the trip.Georgia receives a letter from Robbie stating that there is just too much of an age difference between them (he is 17) and that she should date one of his brothers friends. Well after much heartache Georgia embarks on the project of making Robbie jealous, and dates ""Dave the Laugh"".The book is written as diary and you follow the life of this 14 year old. You will read how she feels about her sister, her best friend, boys, psychotic cat, parents and a considerable amount about how she feels about her body.This is a quick and hilarous read!"
1,none,"4 1/2 stars, really. Not quite as funny as the first one; I got the impression that the author tried a tad to hard. However, it still has all the charms of Angus, Thongs, and Full Frontal Snogging. Very good, and, still, very funny. Worth reading, trust me."
1,Georgia is back and funny then ever.,"Georgia is back and this time she is finally dating the Sex God.... She is happy with her life to a point but freaking out because in just a few week she and her family is suppose to be moving to what Georgia calls Kiwi-a-gogo or New Zealand.From the start Georgia is trying to figure out any possible way to stay back home and be around Robbie or her friends, but she starts to realize that it won't be a possiblity. That is till things take a twist. She loses something importment to her, but she also finds out that she isn't moving away.From here Georgia trys everything in her ways to get the one things she wants more in life back. The ways she trys things is funny and made me laugh because I can actullly see a young girl doing these things in order to get the one thing in life they want back.Overall I can't wait for the next book about Georgia."
1,Opinion,"I personally enjoyed this book a great deal. It has so many emotions that many teenagers go through crammed into one little book. A lot of it was hilarious and real. I could kind of relate to Georgia, the main character.There were numerous parts that I thought were the best. I especially liked how Georgia and Robbie got back together in the end. I also like the creativity of Georgia's plan to make Robbie notice her. And her attempt to get back together with him.Throughout the book I could picture everything. It was all so vivid, and I had my own idea of what everything looked like. The characters were described really well according to Georgia's eye, and I knew the plot was well thought of. The conflict was definately believable, and how she tries to solve it is funny."
1,"On The Bright Side, there are two other books in the trilogy","After reading ""Angus, Thongs, & Full Frontal Snogging"", I had expected a lot more from author Louise Rennison. It is still an excellent read, and it gives an interesting perspective of life through the eyes of a normal teenager, but it doesn't have quite the same quality as ""Angus"" or the next sequel, ""Knocked Out By Nunga Nungas"". If you enjoy this book, I would definitely recommend the other two."
1,You will not like this book...you'll love it,I was very unsure how this one would set up against it's predesessor but it's brilliant. That's all- go out and a buy it. You'll love it. Again Georgia is set up against the horrible misfortune of her teenage life. I can't say anything more- so go read.
1,hecka funny!,this book is soo funny i agree with everyone!! you cant help but laugh!! but one thing i didnt like is that she seems way more materialistic and concieted in this book then the first!! that is one of the reasons i only gave it a 4 instead of a 5!!the main plot of this book is for georgia to get the sex god back after he says that she is too young for him!! so she uses this guy(dave the laugh) to make the sex god jelous and in the end she........sorry you have to read it too see if she gets him back!also her parents tell her she has to move to new zealend cuz her dad found a job there! and thats basically it!all and all i recommend this book you will laugh so hard it hurts!!
1,Funnier than the first,this book is funnier than the first one READ THIS BOOK georgia boyfreind dumped her because shes 14 and hes 17 so now she trieing to make him jealous by dating his younger brother and then............
1,"Just what a mother wants in a book title, NOT!","My 11 y/o daughter picked this out and I thought I had better ""preview"" it. It is the funniest thing I have read in a long time! Because any particular tragedy can mean the ""end of the world as we know it"", plus the fact that our lovely daughters would NEVER be the ""drama queen"" that Georgia is, plus that the book is written by a British author with Brit slang, all add up to a GREAT BOOK. My daughter laughs out loud, looks up words in the included British-to-American glossary, and says this book is better than any TV or Video. She even took it to the POOL and read aloud to her friends!!"
1,"Sometimes, I wish I was a 14 year old British girl..","..or maybe I just wish I had these books when I was a 14 year old American girl? Georgia is an absolute hoot, and so are her mates. Every character is well-developed (as seen from Georgia's perspective, though), and the journal-entry style just sucks the reader in until suddenly the book is finished. Georgia herself is extremely realistic, completely self-centered, but also marvelously lovable. Much appreciated is the British slang glossary at the end, which Georgia has written herself, in her own unique style. Excellent book for teens and pre-teens and a nice break from reading depressing things for 28-year-old me."
1,Good,Good classic cartoon with an inspirational message.(Although not as entertaining as the original.)
1,The Best,"Arguably,there is no better sight in this world than an ample slice of Maytag Blue Cheese in all of its glory,sitting next to a big glass of mysterious, yet sensuous, purple hued American Cabernet: ready and waiting for you to devour.On top of that, this not-of-this-world Blue is also great when added to mashed potatoes or a Yukon Gold potato salad.This stuff is addictive, fattening, rich, savory... yet praise the Lord...it has not one single Carb!"
