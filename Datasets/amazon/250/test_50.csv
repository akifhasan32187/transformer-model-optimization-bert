0,crap,"This cd was a huge disappointment. After two amazing cds, this one sucks. Mr.Gore was a huge part of the group and a big void is left without him. The other vocalist is fine but cant really sing a whole song by himself. I hope they get the old singer back because this cd stunk. The writing is fine but the cd suffers from vocals."
0,Could have done better,"Mutilated in minutes and Only tools and corpses are both amazing cds,but this one i didnt really think that highly of.I think its cause the songs arent as catchy,but still from a personal level i dont think its that good.I mainly gave it two stars cause the only song i think thats good is ""selection and dissection of parts for ressurection"". So yeah,i dont really reccomend this cd"
0,Pure garbage,"This band is NOT a ""goregrind"" band, and they're not even a good death metal band either. Awful cover art also. Pass up on this and buy anything else from IMPETIGO, HAEMORRHAGE, IMPALED, ENGORGED, LORD GORE, etc."
0,Not worth buying,I had this for over a year. The nonstick wore off easily over time and one day it just stopped working. Not happy with this product.
0,Lousy rice cooker,Water never fails to boil and overflow out of cooker when cooking rice. Makes a mess on the countertop. Rice gets burnt at the bottom. Don't buy this!
0,Greasy and Smelly,"This product is greasy, and it has a powdery smell - like cheap creams. Well, what can you expect since it is a cheaper product....I won't buy again for sure!"
0,Wasn't Right for Me,"I was excited about this cream, but then when I used it it broke out my skin :(Not right for me."
0,It makes no difference.,I did not notice any positive results by using this cream.It did not have any bad side effects either. So you may not need it.
0,Put these cowboys out to pasture,"I read great things about this book in the NY Times review, and was really disappointed. The story was flat and repetitious, the writing amateurish, the charaters one-dimensional. Bummer."
0,Disappointed; Sent the wrong item.,"I am disappointed; I was sent the wrong book.I have e-mailed the vendor, but have not gotten a response."
0,Not A Good Vehicle For Krishnamurti's Teachings,"This collection of a bunch of very short commentaries misses its mark. The commentaries open up with Krishnamurti laying down a setting and/or background of the people concerned with the topics presented. Then, they just crumble away into short, mostly ambiguous, commentaries. If you aren't familiar with Krishnamurti's terminology & philosophy, these commentaries can be very confusing. If you are familiar with him, you'd probably agree that they flat-out aren't very good for the most part. I did brighten in finding some of his ideas expressed quickly & to the point, in ways not spoken in other works. But, for the most part, I thought the majority missed their mark."
0,This is not THE A-Team,"Sorry, but this movie is just a bunch of wannabees. The real A-Team was from the 80's. I can't stand to watch wannabees. I can't only watch the real deal and these guys aren't it."
0,A Team,"I bought this for my friends birthday. When we watched it- it started getting stuck and scrambling all over the place- right at the exciting ending. We tried taking it out- inspecting the back of the disc, and wiping it- but that did absolutely nothing. Complete waste of money..."
0,How did the A Team get started?,"i really think they were trying to tell a story of BEFORE the hit TV show, only they bombed.if you are thinking of bying this movie because you loved the TV show of the 80s then stay away. rent it, watch it on On Demand, download it (ooops, that isn't always legal). Watch it when you have gone through your library of movies and need something to watch and you are bored."
0,"It should be called ""The D Team""","- There's a lot of action and explosions but they're not exciting.- There's no suspense or surprise either. It's just like any old action movies I've seen before. For example, there's a scene where a guy shooting from a tank dropped from a plane. I've seen it before but I don't remember in which movie.- The acting is wooden.In short, there's nothing worth watching here. It should be called ""The D Team""."
0,Genuinely Mind Numbing Movie,"Basically no plot. The action shots are incredible, but it still was a complete bore. Jessica Beil maybe gorgeous but lacks any and all ability to act and does NOT fit into the role of a ""tough"" military type, it truly was painful to watch. I expected so much more... DISAPPOINTED. My opinion: Skip It"
0,Will not load on my blu-ray player...,"I actually like the movie, but I have went through 5-6 copies of this movie, and it will not load on my blu-ray player... The very first copy I got played the first time, but every time there after (and every copy since) reads ""load"" then ""home"", and then a counter/timer reads from ""0.00"" to ""0.07"" and freezes there... I just updated the firmware on my player, and still it will not work... I will not buy this title again, at least not on blu-ray..."
0,Liam ought to be ashamed of himself,"I gave up after an hour. This movie is far to silly, and confusing. If there is a story, it is well beyond me. Just trash!"
0,"Lol, not the movie",This is just an 8 minute video of the premier of this movie. Why they would even offer this on Amazon video is beyond me. Don't waste your time.
0,Where's the BEEF!???,"Ya know... when you get roped into buying Amazon Prime and told you get all sorts of free movies, you kind of want to believe them. SO, being gullible as I am, I saw ""A Team"" as being a freebie when I did my search. ... Am I the only one that thinks a 6 minute preview is lame for a 'free movie' offering?"
0,DUMB!,THIS IS NOT A FREE MOVIE! At least put FREE TRAILER or Behind the scenes.. UGH! I think its' stupid that amazon is trying to trick us.
0,bullcrap,Why does amazon continue to trick us with these short and junk stuff. You click this thinking it is the movie and its not. At least Netflix has the actual movies they advertise. Come on Amazon
0,Plot? Where?,"My wife & I watched this last night and just laughed at how bad the lines and plot were. There are some nice action sequences but some of the scenes are just TOO fake to be believable. It's maybe worth a rent, but I regret purchasing it b/c I know we will never want to watch it again. If you are okay with bad lines and totally impossible action sequences, then you might like this one. My wife would be mad that I actually gave this 2 stars instead of 1."
0,just the trailer?,"Should have paid more attention. Wasn't the movie it downloaded-just the trailer.Didn't notice it was 2 min long.It was free,should've known.Pay attention!"
0,very disappointed,When I put it in my DVD player it says bad disk. It won't play in either of my DVD players.
1,By far the best Blue...,Maytag is by far the best blue cheese on the market today.Worth every penny!
1,Lovely Voice,"Vera Lynn is a favorite from my father's early days.My favorites are from her WWII era: We'll Meet Again, White Cliffs of Dover, Wish Me Luck (As You Wave Me Goodbye), There'll Always Be an England, Nightingale Sang in Berkeley Square.More well known in the UK than the US. We'll Meet Again and White Cliffs of Dover are her best remembered.Another wonderful voice from that era is Jo Stafford, who is known for I'll be Seeing you and Long Ago and Far Away."
1,Great CD,"I have been involved with WWII Reunions for 20 years, this is a perfect CD to add to anyones collection"
1,Not Your Typical Gay Novel,"I was at first skeptical of this novel when I read the book jacket, but within the first couple of pages I was completely engrossed in the formation of these beautifully drawn characters. Martin Foreman skillfully develops two very unique and distinctive voices, detailing the day to day lives of the main characters. It is his eye for the little touches that really makes this book work. This is not an action adventure story, as one might presume of a kidnapping story, but an in-depth analysis of the traumas and mundanities of the time spent waiting for the release of a hostage.... With it comes a laymanâ€™s understanding of world sociology. A worthy read."
1,Going Monkey Native,"I'd never heard of English author Martin Booth before. He wrote this personal memoir, recounting 3 years of his childhood in Hong Kong in the early 1950s, just before he recently died of brain cancer. He dedicated the book to his own children, as a way to pass on the story of his life to them. It reads like a novel - one incredible adventure after the next of a boy of 7 let loose on the streets of Hong Kong in the wild years after WWII. It also details the breakdown of the marriage of his mother and father. This is a real treasure trove, a look at the world through the new eyes of a child, but guided by the wise older hand of an older author. I feel like I have traveled and lived in Hong Kong - the sites, sounds, smells - the culture, food, weather, animals, people - all brilliantly alive and real. I also have a better sense of the Chinese and what it means to be Chinese, and a desire to learn more. I only wish Martin had a memoir of his entire life!"
1,Delightful,"I loved reading this wonderful book about Hong Kong and Martin Booth childhood there. I will read more of his books and maybe someday visit Hong Kong. I wish that I could write more about the book, but english is not my language and that limits me. Read the book, I promise you will love it!"
1,Gweillo - Martin Booth,"This book was originally published in the UK as 'Gweillo' (Foreign Devil) and is a delightful and colorful journey through the childhood of the author, Martin Booth who was a school friend of ours.It is a must read for all who spent time in Hong Kong in the colonial days - it will bring back many fond memories.It was written soon before Martin succumbed to brain cancer - he was determined to finish it.I love the book!"
1,"A ""Golden"" book for sure!","This book was recommended to me by a friend who said she was sad when it ended. Well, I am recommending it, and also sad when it ended. It is a delightful memoir of a blond 9 year old boy living in Hong Kong in the 1940ties. Blond means ""luck"" to the Chinese and everyone wanted to pat his head. He learned Chinese and was allowed into areas that no other ""white"" person could go."
1,Packs a punch. This is a rare and complete book that reads like a text. A must have if interested in Brazil in any form.,"Only the highest mark for this outstanding work. If you're interested in Brazil, this is the book you want. Thank you Joeseph Page for this fantastic novel that could easily qualify as a sociological journal. This is without a doubt my favorite book in years."
1,Excellent introduction to Brazil,"Having read most of the introductory books on Brazil, I find the books by Joseph Page to be an excellent basic resource and an enjoyable read to boot."
1,Great research but a little outdated,"This is a great book if you are interest in the history and culture of Brazil. It's obvious that the author did extensive research on the subject and he does a very good job explaining how some of the cultural traits developed. However, the country has gone under a great deal of changes recently and so I though it was a little outdated. Also, the reading can get boring, as the chapters are long and too detailed sometimes. I gave it four stars because it's definitely a good book, if this is the kind of reading you are looking for."
1,Married to a Brazilian,"My wife and I met in Seminary. She is from Brazil and we plan on moving there when I graduate. I have been to Brazil several times over the past few years and have fallen in love with their culture. But until I read this book, I did not know much of the history of South America's largest country. Page's book is an easy read, entertaining, and very factual. I found my self turning to my wife on a regular basis to discuss what I had just read. He was always right on! If you are planning a mission, vacation, or know a bunch of Brazilians, you have got to read this book. Call it Brazilian History 101. A great intro into Brazil's culture and history"
1,A realists look at Brazil,"This is a wonderful book and a must-read for anyone who wishes to either live in Brazil or to travel in Brazil.It covers Brazil's contemprary history in depth and from the optic of a realist. It is beautifully written and pulls no punches about the things in Brazil's history which are challenging Brazil today as it struggles to take it's place on the world satge as an emerging economic power.Sadly the book's coverage misses out on the ascension of Lula to the presidency, but this matters not a jot, as the book's wide sweep through Brazil's recent past is compelling in its clarity of opinion as to the social pressures Brazil faces.Thoughout the book Brazil is referred to as a paradox in all senses, and as anyone who has ever spent time in Brazil will tell you - that is it's wonder and it's power."
1,A must read for anyone's list.,I am surprised by how few people know of this book. An excellent novel protraying the master/disciple relationship and questions of ones destiny. It is a pleasure to read.
1,Angela Lansbury Rules!!!,Angela Lansbury rules in this seafaring movie set during the American War of 1812.It's a must see!!
1,Incredible!,This is a historically significant collection of jazz videos! The visual and sound quality are excellent. Highly recommended!
1,Good set,"My husband enjoyed this set for his birthday. Nice to buy them all together, since they were no longer available in our public library."
1,The Furies,Also very good read and highly recommended. The whole Kent family series has the reader wanting more books in the series
1,America's History with the Kent family,It has been over 30 years since I read these books the first time. They are even more relevant now. Fascinating writing about our counrty's birth as experienced by the fictional Kent family.

1,"Not cheap, but worth the price.","We had previously bought cheaper magnetic clear lid containers. It was a waste of money. They rusted, the lids wouldn't come off etc. Pure junk. I found these locally for a bit over 3 bucks each. We have been using them for over a year with no issues. Open as good as the day I bought them.Watch what you pay and look locally before buying on line. Most better kitchen shops will have them. If Amazon carried them directly, I'd buy that way."
1,Perfect for space-saving,"I have had these for quite a while and recently bought 4 more. We have very limited counter space so this was the perfect alternative to a countertop spice rack. However, I was being dumb when I bought the first set and didn't realize there is a small groove on the side that allows the lid to ""lock"" in place. Not realizing the lid was in the ""locked"" position, I forced a few of them open and over time those ones cracked. It was my own fault. But the magnets on the back are very strong and these are very durable as long as you don't break them like I did. I give it 4 stars because i do think $4-5 a piece is too expensive. But you can't find them anywhere else, so, I spend the money."
1,One of all-time best UK 1960's bands,"An absolutely perfect anthology. Lots of first-time stereo....great sound and plenty of information. Get this and Volume 2 ""Biff Bang Pow"" before it's too late."
1,Great for gym,"I bought these as gym shorts for my daughter. They're comfortable (my daughter wants a pair for home) and durable--she's been wearing them for half a year and I see no snags, holes in seams or general wear at all. They do run a little small, she was in a girls size 12 jean when I bought these and she fit in the adult small very comfortably though there was little difference between that size and youth large. (I bought both sizes thinking she'd grow into the adult sm) I will be buying more in the near future as she's hit a growth spurt."
1,excellent value,"these are an excellent buy.they're not the best construction, but compared to expensive shorts that probably come from the same Chinese sweatshop, they've done just fine by me."
