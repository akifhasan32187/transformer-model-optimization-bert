0,WHO THREW THAT CHAIR ONTO THE SET?,"I watched this when it came out, and have returned to it years later.And how different it seems in retrospect.The acting is wooden - it's as if someone threw a chair onto the set. There are some good performances but in the main the order of the day is clipped upper class Englishness with warmth and humanity drained away. All very sterile.The writing and dialogue is at times painful, stilted and unreal, with the delivery of lines from the actors forced and almost alien.Some other strange stuff too: the uncle liked little girls (in a sexual way)and this was shrugged off as mild eccentricity. How times have changed since the 1990s !What is good about this series is the historical references and the depiction and sense of the war years.Well worth watching but not the greatest piece of drama."
0,Disappointed.,We were completely disappointed in this DVD. It has so much nudity in the first 20 minutes we could not finish watching it. We cannot recommend this DVD to anyone. We returned it for a refund.
0,"Amusement park entertainment in a theatre! Oh,joy....","Special effects extravaganza, without a doubt. Very beautiful people, (especially Oded Fehr who adroitly delivers the only bearable character). Otherwise, populated by shallow and stereotypic personages. Script hangs by a thread with tongue-in-cheek humor. Oded Fehr admonishes while Brandon Frasier smirks, Rachel Weiss bubbles, John Hannah whines, and Arnold Vosloo up-chucks. Just what you'd expect on a roller-coaster ride."
0,Two Hours of My Life That I'll Never Have Back!,"To call this movie funny or in any way resembling an Indiana Jones movie is a great mistake. Aside, from some impressive special effects, this movie has no redeeming qualities. I enjoy lighter cinematic fare as much as the next guy, but the script here is awful and the acting even worse. Don't say I didn't tell you so!"
0,Yet another of those..,"Just another mainstream sci-fi wanna-be-great film wrapped in a commercial packing. Watch it a dull sunday afternoon when there's nothing else on tv, but not worth buying on dvd."
0,HD DVD Video Quality Review,"This HD-DVD uses the same transfer as the standard DVD from 1999. Although the increased resolution offers far more detail, defects such as dirt & film weave are now more apparent. The contrast seems to be artificially lifted, clipping details both in the high and low end of the image (The Universal logo at the beginning of the film never looked this ugly), making it look processed and not film-like.Compared to reference HD-DVDs auch as ""King Kong"" this is a slightly below average transfer (2/5)"
0,Neither here nor there,"I'm still not sure whether this film was intended to be a spoof or not. If so, it lacked enough laughs to be considered as such. On the other hand, if it was intended as a serious horror film it also fell short of the mark. There wasn't a single moment of tension. All in all, it was a bit like a carry on film. Not a patch on the Indiana Jones films."
0,Very Cheesy,"Like the reviews says, if you're looking for a shallow, cheesy movie, this is the movie for you.Cliches? Check. Annoying bad guy lackey? Double check. Predictable plot, mostly a vehicle for special effects? Check.I mean, you've got a guy alone in a tunnel, and you need to grab his body, so you just grab his tongue and eyes? Makes for some icky looking scenes as he tries to talk and wanders around blindly with bandages over his eyes, but I can't even begin to understand why, except for the icky scenes. Plus it gives the lackey a chance to show what an evil double crossing lackey he is. That's the sort of movie this is.It's Indiana Jones without good acting, but on the plus side it has cool special effects."
0,Don't buy the full screen version,"Be carefully which version buy. Unlike other studios that offers both full and widescreen on the same DVD, Universal is dumb and greedy enough to release two versions. Check the right version before you buy. The full frame version must from the VHS tape master which is less detail and grainy compares to the widescreen version not to mention mutilated the film.The sound is the same for both films, which are good but not great. Wish they had DTS version instead of the full frame.Four stars for the widescreen version on audio and video.Three stars for the content as a decent B movie."
0,For the Mindless Only,"The Mummy moves far too fast to be a good horror flick,and it's far too predictable to be a good action movie. Substituting special effects for plot development and real acting, the Mummy will satisfy most viewers looking for mindless escapism. However, anyone looking for anything deeper will walk away disappointed. Save your money and go see the Sixth Sense while it's still in the theaters."
0,Don't bother,"I was very disappointed in this movie. Too many typical scenes, an unconvinsing villian, a screwball hero and idiots all around him. It was more like a national lampoon version. I did like the way the mummy traveled, but I wish the story was better, and I wish there was more real wonder and a thought-provoking plot."
0,Rent this for you and your friends,"to make fun of. This was a poor attempt at camp. The acting was way too over the top, the plot was paper thin. The special F/X were the only redeeming quality. If you truly want fun and camp rent ""Army of Darkness"" or ""Big Trouble in Little China"". This one isn't worth it, unless it's on cable late at night."
0,Amazon Scammed Me Of My Free Ticket,"The movie is great in Blu-Ray as are almost all of them. Unfortunately, the Amazon version of this movie did not come with the movie discount for the new movie. Other stores have it for the same price so just buy it elsewhere and get the discount ticket. Wish Amazon would have disclosed that before I bought it."
0,Stupid absolutely horrible!,This was one of the worst movies! I have seen to date! If you enjoy this there is something truly wrong with you. How can one man get away from danger so much?!Its special effects nothing more and a lot less! Brendan Fraser is a bad actor with a soon to be short movie career! Boo to the people that enjoy this movie! Hooray to the people who understand what I mean!
0,bleh!,"Words cannot describe my excitement for this movie. However, five minutes into the movie a feeling of dread fell over me. My girlfriend leaned over to me and asked, ""Is this a comedy?"" What happened here, this is supposed to be a horror movie, not a slapstick comedy. I enjoyed Steven Sommer's Deep Rising, but this is ludicrous. Fraser churns out the typical Hollywood tough guy character. Rachel Weisz, is nice to look at, but not to listen to. The special effects are decent enough, but they seem to be more important in the movie than the actual conflict. This came out the same summer as the awful Austin Powers 2, and the even worse Deep Blue Sea, t'was a bleak summer for me. If it wasn't for The Matrix, I would have given up on movies all together."
0,Bad Bad Bad,Another example of a possibly good screenplay being totally ruined by bad direction and even worse editing. Buyer Beware!
0,What an overrated flick!,"I was so bored, that's all I can say. Actually, parts were funny because they tried hard to be scary or suspenseful. In my eyes this movie is a flop."
0,NO COMMENT,"AS I LIVE IN EUROPE, I HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO WATCH THIS BLU RAY DVD.THE FORMAT WAS NORMALLY ""ALL REGIONS"" BUT I GUESS THAT ONLY THE PEOPLE WITH A REGION 1 APPARATUS COULD WATCH IT. SO I SPENT MY MONEY FOR NOTHING. WHAT A DISAPPOINTMENT. I WANTED TO SEND IT BACK TO AMAZON BUT FINALLY I CHANGED MY MIND BECAUSE I WOULD I HAVE LOST MONEY."
0,Don't waste your money,This was one of the WORST movies I have ever seen. We found ourselves laughing all the way through.
0,It's a big let down !,"Anything about Egypt conjures up visions of greatness and mystery. The movie, in spite of the special effects, is a big disappointment with its weak story, third rate acting and cheap humour."
0,Effects can't do it all!,"The Mummy is surely one of the worst films this year. This film proves, that some fancy computereffects can't save a stupid history with some ekstremly stupid acting. It tries to follow Indiana Jones all the way, but the result is so sad. I'am very disapointed..."
0,Typical formula movie,"Typical formula movie. X number of car chases, X number of shoot-outs, X number of explosions. Good special effects can't save a movie with no suspense, no mystery, and no atmosphere. This movie bears no resemblance to the original. Save your money, this is a waste."
0,This movie is Unbearable!,"This film is just plain bad, astoundingly so. The one liners were so stupid I was actually embarrassed for the actors that had to deliver them. And Brendan Fraser never even took off his shirt! :( Someone please scrape this movie off the bottom of my shoe."
0,Horrible!!,"As one of the other reviewers noted -- it frightens me that so many others thought so highly of this movie. Acting and story were terrible, pacing was worse -- even the FX weren't that great."
0,Pathetic Waste of Time,"My vote for worst movie of the year. I kept hopeing that all of the characters would get eaten by bugs or slaughtered by the pharohs guards ASAP as they were all so incredibly STUPID they might as well have been begging for it. Don't even try to compare this piece of *** to Indiana Jones or Stargate. The scariest thing about this film is all of the 5-star ratings that I see here. I'll really think twice next time before buying a film on the basis of one of these reviews. BTW, I sometimes think that professional movie critics are overly hard on some films for not being ""deep"" or intelectual enough. In this case though I think they were right on."
0,Horrible,The characters had no redeaming qualities. The special effects were good but could not save the movie. The actors played camp all the way.
0,Marketing at its best!,To sum it - I could have waited for this movie to go to Prime Time cable. It's not even worth renting. The acting is awful and the budget of the movie went primarily to special effects. And if that was the case then the final scene of the monster dying was horribly done. Boy did the marketing department of this movie studio ever fool me. If I could give a zero star - I would.
0,"If you're under 8 years old, you're gonna'love this movie","This movie is just plain boring. The acting is flat, the 'special effects' aren't, and it just seems to try to be to much 'Indiana Jones' formula. Skip this one for sure."
0,Encino Man goes to Egypt,"After watching the Mummy the entire cast of the movie should of been mummified and place in a crypt for eternity. The acting was horrible and the special effects were at best "" chessy "". The Mummy in my opinion was the worst movie of 1999. I wouldn't recommend this DVD."
0,Like wet sand in my underwear.,"This movie was good: good like catching a soup-plate in the throat at high velocity. Beyond the cheesy special effects (and if you thought they were good I have a lovely ""pong"" game I could sell you), all the viewer is left with is an empty feeling where good acting should have been. I also have to equate its script content with an adult-form Barney movie in its diluted attempt at entertainment. It was scary alright. Scary inasmuch as the masses opinion that ""the mummy"" was more fun than self-mutilation. I just wonder exactly how much the entertainment business will have to eat before it explodes from overconsumption. Heaven help us if this movie was intended to be ""good""."
0,YOU'VE BEEN WARNED!,"A huge disappointment. The creature was a poor ""Terminator"" rip-off. The acting was terrible, and the movie's slapsticky tone was extremely annoying. One of the worst movies of the year!"
0,DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME!!!,"This movie is a joke! I'll admit that it has some neat effects but the film just flat out SUCKED! They try and make the film funny when it should be serious which makes it even more stupid because of their ""funny"" jokes. Give me a break! Only see this film if your willing to waste your money."
0,More sizzle than steak....,"I tire easily of movies that use special efforts as justification for their existence. ""The Mummy"" is just such a picture. I am of the opinion that special effects should be used like salt and pepper, i.e., to be used sparingly to enhance the experience. However, just as I would never recommend a meal based on spices, I don't recommend movies that have tons of special effects, but with a weak story line and weak acting.Leave this movie for the ""techies"" who have to have the ""latest and greatest"" in their technological whiz-bang world."
0,Good hollywood thinking,When I saw this movie I was so grateful that the producers didn't waste any money on screenwriters directors or actors... they sunk every penny into special effects... isn't that what America wants?
0,Worst movie ever,A good example of what is wrong with Hollywood today. I have never looked at my watch more times during a movie in my life. Brendan Fraser is one of the worst actors ever.
0,"The ""movie"" of doom","I am glad that I missed the threater release. This is one of the WORST movie. Cheesy acting, average special effect, stupid plot line ......"
0,TROUGH OUT,I HAVE WATCHED THIS FOOLISH MOVIE A MONTH AGO. IT'S FOR FOOLISH PEOPLE WHO HAS NO TIME TO FINDOUT A BETTER MOVIE LIKE ME MY WIFE ASK ME WHY IT FOOLISH IS BECAUSE I HAVE NEVER SEEN A MUMMY !! WHICH SCARE OF A STUPID CAT IF TELL THE TRUTH THIS MOVIE HELPS EGYPT TO BRING SOME FOOLISH TOURISTS TO EGYPT. TOWN OF TERRORISM BY THE WAY I HOPE THERE WILL BE NO TERRORISM IN EGYPT SOON .
0,Don't waste your time with this one!,"The only good thing about this movie was the trailer. The trailer leads you to believe you'll be horrified and well entertained. The movie is actually a horrible comedy and does not even come close to being interesting or entertaining. Filled with numerous Egyptian landscape errors, the sets look contrived and the effects are lackluster, save for the wind storm. What ever happened to using little models anyway? Computer generated effects just don't give the sense of realism as models. If you like poor acting, lame scripts and don't care about accuracy in depicting the setting you might, just might like the movie."
0,Waste of time and money,"I cannot believe I was sucked into watching the movie by their attention-grabbing trailer! I saw all of these special effects and the Mummy- hey, I'm into ancient civilizations, so why not? After twenty minutes of this shallow plot, I couldn't even squeeze a chuckle out of me. Good grief, what an insult to my intelligence! I guess I can watch this if I have nothing better to do or if I wanted ""who-cares-if-it's-stupid-I-just-want-to-be-entertained movie"", but I'm a busy person. What a waste of those great special effects over a dumb plot! I felt conned, like an idiot: those stereo-types they did, sheesh, hello?! It could've been better. I should have taken my money to the other show: the Matrix, I saw that on video and would have been cool to have seen in it on a cinema. Oh, well...."
0,Just falls flat.,"This movie had potential for being good, however the desire to make money ruined that potential. What we're left with is the generic tale of a mummy out for revenge."
0,"cheep effects, not worth buying at all","the acting was pretty cheesy, and the special effects were not at all realistic. Not a good movie at all."
0,Dummy Mummy,"This movie at times seemed to parellel The Indiana Jones movies, down to near direct quotes ""I hate snakes"" however in The Mummy it was ""I hate bugs"". Alot of the sets and costumes were Indiana Jones inspired.Not only were the actors as dry as the desert they were in, there were it seemed a series of endless shootout scenes, horses running, guns firing, dust flying. These action sequences are nothing more than time fillers and BOREING to watch. The humour in The Mummy was a total distraction and offset the mood of the entire film. It turned into this hokey comedy of sorts, which truely rings pathetic in my book.The romance and pychological aspects of the older monster movies is missing here. It has been replaced by mindless special effects, and what seemed like an endless array of confusing action sequences. Dull characters, dull storyline plus dazzling special effects equal dumb movie. You need more than cool effects!"
0,Yawn!!!,"I figured that the reason I fell asleep the first time I tried to watch this movie was just because I was tired. Tried to watch it again and the same thing happened.Special affects were good. The rest of the movie just stunk. Plot holes to drive a truck through. poor acting and some of the worst dialogue I've ever heard were enough to move this into my list of all time worst movies.Of course the inane premise should have been enough to warn me off. Let me sum it up. Egyptian High Priest is screwing around with the Pharoah's mistress. He does this out in the open where Pharoah can walk in. Pharoah comes in and with his bodygaurds right behind him. The kill him.What do they do to punish this high priest? They put a curse on him where if he is ever released, he will be the most powerful creature to ever walk the planet and end all life as we know it. Ummmm... Why not just torture him for a while and then kill him...."
0,For the brain dead only,"The fact that this movie has been compared to Raiders of the Lost Ark is sacrilege. This is a pale imitation of several different (and better) films made by people who seem to think that special effects make a good substitute for an original story and decent characterisation. The stereotyping of the characters is annoying and offensive. The Egyptians are all dirty and rude, the Americans are gun-crazy rambo's, the English are bumbling idiots (we're not all librarians you know!). Rachel Weisz and John Hannah were painful to watch at times. The most interesting character was Ardeth Bey who only had a small supporting role. Completely disappointing - it could've been so much better."
0,The Critics were right: This movie blows,"OK. Brendon Frasier can't act, so they came up with a supporting cast that wouldn't make him look too bad. Translation: Bad acting across the board There are absolutely no redeeming qualities about this film. The Egyptians portrayed in this film are, to a man, bumbling, shady characters bent on trickery or murder. Pathetic. There was nothing scary about the Mummy himself. Most of the time they use a computer generated character (the kind we see in every ""horror"" movie these days) who is about as convincing as Jar Jar Binks. When the Mummy finally becomes a ""real man"", they use a bald, smirking goofball that runs around in a silly loincloth and looks like Right Said Fred. I saw this movie with friends and the sentence that was said out loud the most often was: ""I can't believe how bad this is"". Spend your money, take your chances"
0,Right Series ... Wrong Movie!!!,I purchased the original Movie but was sent the second movie of the Mummy series. Very disappointed! The movie works fine just not what I wanted!Not worth paying the shipping and sending it back for the correct movie ... I was definately taken on this one! I would have to say BEWARE of this seller!
0,All of what is BAD,"Please tell me it hasn't come to this ... Embarassing film with wooden acting and generic, ""by-the-numbers"" direction and visuals ... Avoid like a plague of poorly done computer bugs ... This is what is wrong with American filmmaking these days ..."
0,terrible,the only thing you get here is special effects. the story is weak if i have ever seen one and Brenden Fraser is a really bad actor. don't see it!
0,"Totally boring, the worst movie I've seen this year","I'd have to say even a totally hyped film such as Phantom Menace is better than this. Where's the story? I watched half of it and then turned it off. It's now sitting in an auction where I hope someone will actually be it off me. Try The Matrix instead which I also bought, but thought was actually quite good."
0,The worst movie since Ace Ventura Pet Detective,"I've no idea how people rate this movie more than a single star. I heard about the special effects before I seen the movie and expected something impressive. What I got however, was terrible special effects that I could have produced on an Amiga 10 years ago (the beetles floating on top of the ground for example). OK the face in the sand was quite good, but that was it. It has none of the pace or humour of the Indiana Jones series. Anyone who's looking for a '90s Indiana Jones should wait for the fabled Fate of Atlantis."
0,A total waste of my money and time,"There is not much of anything good I can say about The Mummy. The truth is, Brendan Fraser can't carry a movie. The creative team behind the movie knew this, so they tried to jazz it up with lots of hokey special effects. The script was even worse. I do have one question, why didn't they show all of the plagues instead of only like four of them? But, anyway, this movie was just another let down in the mold of Godzilla (1998), because I was really looking forward to its release, but the hype was too much and the result was a horrible waste of my time and money."
0,DISGUSTING!,I wish I could put into words how horrible the movie was. I only watched half the film before falling asleep. And another thing; I know why there are so many reviews saying that it is better in widescreen. The answer is it takes up less of your screen. It is so bad that I rooted for the people to die.
0,You've got to be kidding me!!!,"This movie is absolute crap! I just watched it, and I can't possibly express how disgusted I am with all this wasted time I can never get back. I almost want to cry. To begin with, the special effects are the best thing in the movie, and even they suck. The plot basically consists of a bunch of people dying and no one seeming to care, and a bunch of bugs running around. That this apathetic waste of space would be geared towards kids--or anyone for that matter--makes me physically ill. Never, ever watch this! I can't believe some people like this! Between the swiss cheese plot and unimaginative storytelling, I'd rather watch grass grow. Please, please, please stay away from this movie!"
0,No Dolby Digital 5.1!,"If you don't have a DTS decoder on your receiver, then don't even bother. The 5.1 audio on this disc is DTS ONLY, with the only Dolby audio being a lousy Dolby Pro-Logic 2.0 mix. Hardly the ""Purest Digital Sound Available"" that it falsely claims on the back of the box. Yeah...""purest"" IF you have DTS equipment. Had I known this beforehand I wouldn't have bought it. Of course, who would even think to check since just about every DVD ever made has had a 5.1 channel. What is especially insulting is that the main menu audio is in 5.1. It would have been nice to have a warning or disclaimer on the box. What's the point of a hi-def format when muddy, bogus 2-channel audio is all that's available for someone with a Dolby Digital setup? Especially since its available on the standard (and supposedly inferior?) DVD release? Do they want us to buy a new $300 receiver just to play one movie? What a joke. If you only have a Dolby setup, avoid this release."
0,Suckfest 2000,"Is this what movies are coming to? I learned nothing aboutancient times, or the characters, or even about kung fu! This movieis MTV blurspeed editing that adds nothing to the viewing experience but a headache. This was nonstop movement, NOT action. Add to this visual noise an over the top sountrack that tells us morons stupid enough to watch this ... how we're supposed to feel. I couldn't wait for the music to let me know the climactic ending was coming -- dunt dunt Tah DAHHHHH. But wait, that climax was just a teaser, now there's another, Tahhh DAAHHHHH, and another and another and another... I thought it would never end. So what's the plot? Who knows? I wasn't supposed to wonder about that as I was getting clubbed over the head with the BIGGEST and MOST action (movement)the ancient world has ever known!"
0,Another film made for a reason I can't see,"The gets thrown into the mix with films like ""Fight Club"" and such. Obviously, the makers already new that it wouldn't be hit. With the Mummy, casting Fraiser was a bad idea. Everyone is used to seeing him as a dopey yet cute character in movies like ""George of the Jungle"" and ""Blast From the Past"". I think after the making the total flop ""Dudley Do-Right"", Fraiser wanted to play a different kind of character. Well too late, cause everyone is used to the regular kinds of characters he plays. I was not very impressed because of this fact."
0,WARNING! STAY AWAY FROM THIS PIECE OF C*&P!,"This movie is terrible in every way. Dont let the flashy special fx fool you! How people can enjoy bad acting, patheticly thin plots and bad artistic direction is beyond me. Do yourself a favor, STAY AWAY FROM THIS MOVIE."
0,Beware!!! No Movie Cash- buy elsewhere.,"Unlike every other retailer, Amazon's Universal DVD's do NOT include the $7.50 in movie cash, and you will not find out until you open it. Thus you can't return it. Don't buy from Amazon, go to Sams- $19.23 or Circuit City or Best Buy."
0,mummy,It was good the only thing I didnt like was the picture on our TV. I dont know to much about DVD movies but the picture was half on the screen. What gives? Movie seemed to fake
0,it's not scary as you thought,"this is so called the new remake of the older Mummy Films.The acting is really bad, cause the director concentrated most only in the special effects.The one truth Mummy movie is ""THE MUMMY 1932 with Boris Karloff as Imhotep""."
0,you 4 and 5 star must not see many movies,"this was an extremely bad movie, just awful. no character development, no plot, just sheesy effects. if you can think then i do not recommend this movie."
0,Burn It!,I bought The Mummy thinking that I'd get an entertaining/exciting action movie... was I sorely mistaken! No amount of special fx this movie throws at you is able overcome the lingering nausea induced by a childish plot and corny Airplane-esque humor. I actually felt deeply embarrassed for the director and cast.I give The Mummy one star for its use as great kindling.
0,The Mummy-DVD,"I haven't received the item above, yet have had two emails to review it. If you've sent it, please verify that it has really gone out. If not, please don't send me another email. Thanks."
0,How *BAD* can a film get!,"Thie is definitely one of the worst pieces of cinematic trash that it has ever been my misfor- tune to see,"
0,What? Did I miss something?,"This movie was completely goofy, nerdy and stupid. It doesn't hold a candle to any Indiana Jones film. The only part that was scary was how lame it was."
0,Tired of Blockbuster Movies,"This movie is a tipical teenager blockbuster: lots of special effects, preatty actors, advanture and comedy all mixed together and cliches, cliches and CLICHES. I get out of my mind when people compare this movie with Indiana Jones. Please! Indiana Jones was original, charming, inteligent, very good acted and, well, let's see... it has a PLOT! Well, I have to say one thing: The Mummy indeed has not a single quality Indiana has ."
0,Indiana Jones Revisited,"I agree with the other gentleman about this being nothing more than a way of doing Indiana Jones all over again. You can see it all over the movie, #1 and #2. Special Effects were very good, but the rest was like watching Harrison Ford again."
0,Make Your Night A Blockbuster Night,This movie would have been good if they didn't add comedy in suspenseful parts. DON'T BUY THIS. RENT IT! BLOCKBUSTER IS GOOD.
0,brenda ain't no indiana jones,this is a boring atempt to make an indiana jones movie it fails at trying to make classic one liners and brendon fraiser aint no indiana jones.......
0,Should have Stayed in Wraps,"I was LOL throughout most of this flick and had no remorse about hitting the rewind a full 10 minutes before the finale. With predictable transparent characters and recycled story lines, this movie plays more like a spoof than an actual sci-fi thriller. Some good special effects seem woefully out of place when draped on a sophomoric story line, like icing on stale cake. The best thing about the video is 1)i didn't waste my money at the box office and 2) it's fair warning about the sequel."
0,Couldn't wait to see it... couldn't WAIT 'til it was over!,Bought bags of Raisenettes and M&M Peanuts to enjoy this movie with... 30 minutes into it and I couldn't wait for it to end. I hate this movie! One of my top 5 all-time bad films. Painful to sit thru!
0,Nice Cartoon,"This would've made a nice cartoon. As a movie--nuh uh.Too hokey the way they did it. WAAAAAAYYYYY too hokey.Oh, and the 25 year old Playboyesque hottie as the ""archaeologist""---oh yeah, that's believable. Like I said, it's a cartoon. Not a movie."
0,A complete and total waste of time and money!,"This film is the worst I've seen all year!To think that this made over 100 million dollars at the box office makes me sick!Terrible acting,directing, script,and some of the worst characterization I have ever seen.Ed Wood could make a more emtrtaining film!The movie's only asset are the so-so special effects.A five year old could make a better movie!Save your money or buy the original Boris Karloff version instead."
0,Disappointing.,"The effects here are sometimes fantastic, though hardly crisp. The dialogue is wretched, and the acting only slightly better. Somehow, it's still almost mildly entertaining - though probably best saved for the Fraser diehards."
0,"In short, it's special effects trash, nothing more.","I was unlucky enough to have seen this movie in the theaters. I should've waited for it to come out on video. NO! I should've waited for it to premiere on network TV had I known it was going to be this bad. ""The Mummy"" is basically an exercise in special effects, and nothing more. At least they could've included something of a plot, but it was nowhere to be found. People said I should see it merely for the effects, although after seeing it, I didn't think they were any better than ""The Matrix"". I don't care for the acting, either. It's an example of what poor casting can do to a film. Now for my attack on the MPAA, I felt that the level of violence in this film was too much for a PG-13 rating. If you disagree with me, then take a close look at the R rated film ""The Matrix"" and decide for yourself which is worse."
0,NOT WHAT I EXPECTED,IF I HAD KNOWN WHAT I SAW ON THIS MOVIE I WOULD NOT HAVE BOUGHT IT. IT WAS NOTHING LIKE THE OLDER MOVIES OF THE MUMMY THAT HELD YOUR INTERST. THIS MOVIE WAS ENTIRELY TOO DULL.
0,The Temple of Doom? This movie is not...,The Mummy fails to capture the same wonder and excitement of the Indiana Jones movies which it tries so obviously hard to do.This movie never really gets off the ground.
0,Give me a break,"Please...the mummy was one of the tackist movies i have ever seen. It had great speical effects and that is where i will stop on the positive commments. It had terrible acting and it also was not belivable. I thought that the movie was also supposed to be ""scary"" but i found myself laughing during the ""scary"" parts. One of Brendon Fraiser's worst movies since George of the Jungle."
0,Weak!,This is the lamest movie I've ever seen. I cant belive people actually like this. The scrypt is absolutely moronic.
0,"The name implies action/suspense, not comedy!","I feel that The Mummy, just the name itself implies an action thriller. The special effects were good, but that doesn't make a movie good. The storyline was ok, but the persistent comedy was annoying. Not that it wasn't funny, but when I go to see a movie called ""The Mummy"", you would think its an indiana jones type thriller. Indiana jones had comical moments, but nothing like in the mummy. Overall, the comedy detracted from the quality of the movie as a whole."
0,"This one was very, very bad","When I read those previews I thought that this was one of those good movies, scary, good story and everything. So I watched it, but I haven't seen the end because I was so bored. The first thing I hated was that I thought that this movie was scary, but is was so not !! I think it can better renamed to a comedy or something like that. And those effects were not so great eather. Fake and not very scary. The scenes were not very good to follow. In one scene they were almost caught, the next scene they were already in their hotel. What's that about ?? Well I hope I'm not too negative, but I have a dozen friends who think the same like me. Massol"
0,One dimentional plot and characters despite special effects,"This movie follows the footsteps of movies such as ""Twister"" and ""Juracic Park"" - rich in effects and no substance. Come on, formula such as ""a girl screw up a spell requiring a handsome guy to rescue her"" is overused. Of course at the end the treasures are lost. Despite some fun moments, this is a one-time rental."
0,Long and Boring,"I watched this movie in the theater, and fell asleep. I thought Id give it a second chance, so I rented it. I fell asleep again. Not only does this movie seem to drag on forever, the acting is horrible and the plot and characters are dumb. Thats the best word to describe this movie. Dumb."
0,"Great Effects, Good Storyline, Bad Casting","Brendan Fraser was the wrong person for the leading role in this movie, he made this movie hokey/cheesy."
0,WHY NOT WIDESCREEN & FULL FRAME ON SAME DISC?,"Hey Universal (and other studios), why not put both widescreen & full frame on the DVD like they began doing. I just bought the DVD and it turned out to be the less desired butchered full frame, so I will return it. Why confuse everyone rather than educate those with the better widescreen version showing everything."
0,Terribly Overrated,"For the life of me, I will never understand the craze about this film. The acting ranged from terrible to 2nd rate, the special effects were too heavy, character development was virtually nonexistent. For a film that has been called the next Indiana Jones, everything in this film is lesser than Speilberg's and Lucas' superb adventure trilogy. I mean, what the heck was up with this film anyway? Brendan Fraser's trying to be an action hero, but also a comedian, just did not work as he never neared achieving either goal. The deaths of several of the good characters had no effect, as we never really got to know them. Not once DURING THE ENTIRE MOVIE was I on the edge of my seat, though it was all I could do to not lean comfortably back and fall asleep in it. Okay, perhaps that's an overstatement and a bit harsh, but this film is not as good as the critics say!"
0,MUMMIFIED.,"What else does this movie have to offer besides sheesy special effects? Certainly not a good script and good acting. It's like, let's hire some third rate actors and blow stuff up! Yeah, yeah hahahahaha! This movie was boreing! I was expecting much more, this was a sheesy movie to say the least! I felt mummified while watching it."
0,Over-digitized Hollywood junk,"This is another example of how Hollywood is using cheesy computer-generated special effects to substitute for plot. This movie is pure junk. The acting is abominable and the story line is stupid. Brandon Fraser looks good though. If you see it, see it just for him."
0,Thank goodness for DVD frame advance feature,"I really did not care for this movie at all. The special effects are very impressive but it stops there. I found myself using the fast frame advance a lot in this movie and it was the first time I have ever seen it. Pointless dialog and dumb jokes interupted some decent action scenes and had no effect on the movie. I even think the Mummy himself was a little whimpy. Yeah he can make neat faces in the sand and he killed a few people but he never really kicked any butt. Maybe I am just compairing it to the Matrix. Glad I rented it. As far as the DVD I liked all of the extra's it had on it. It is always fun to ""explore"" a new DVD."
0,This DVD played on a computer forces you to download softwar,"If you plan to view this DVD on your computer, be aware that you will be required to install PC Friendly software before you can view the film. This software contains, screen savers, postcards, games etc. so if that interests you then it is probably great for you. I for one resented being forced to do this since all I wanted was to add the movie to my collection of DVD's."
0,Thank God I only rented it!,"Well for me this movie had only one saving factor to it. And that is the special effects and the cool Mummy. I think the best way for me to describe the acting is it reminded me of a sitcom in it's first few shows. The actors didn't seem to be comfortable with there characters and it just seemed flat. The one liners where pretty cheesy.All I can say is rent it, if you like it buy it. But don't buy it without seeing it first."
0,What a shame.Could have been GOOD. Characters not developed.,"Could have been a great film. The charactors were not developed to where one could like them or feel empathy for them. The acting and (situation comedy?) was a little hokey.Special effects were fun and very good, but the film missed the oldfashioned scare of the classic horror The Mummy. What a shame!! A lot of $$ was spent on the film."
0,YEEEEEE awn,"Brenda Fraser, please go away! I cannot say this movie was mummy-rific or mummy-tastic, borrowing clever adjectives from some of the other reviewers. What I can say is that I am glad my roommate paid for the rental on this one.The dialogue was canned and the story was absolutely formulaic, to the point where even moderately initiated moviegoers could see the whole plot unfold in the first ten minutes of the ""film.""Actual sample dialogue: ""we're in big trouble."" Followed by the Mummy growling even louder and then, ""We're in REALLY big trouble.""hmm... riveting..The special effects were good, and earn it two stars, but ultimately we are left with a typical polished hollywood beauty and no personality."
0,nice but nothing to get excited about,"well, it is a kind of fun movie, i even bought the dvd and now i am looking for somebody dumb enough to buy it from me. sorry, but i can not understand what folks like about hollywood mass products, full of stupid action, stupid dialogues, and stupid plots, like a jump and run adventure game - a very easy way to spend your way after your successful lobotomy, but no real value. there is just no touch, no really interesting or dramatic moment where the movie gets a hold of you and just knocks you off your feet. please do not buy. watch, if thou wilt, but don't thou buy this piece of brainlessness."
0,Racist Propaganda- I want to put zero stars.,"The real life Imhotep was a master architect, the real father of medicine, and a high priest. How dare you give his name to this character, an adultorus muumy. How would you like it if Ben Franklin, Thomas Edison, and Albert Einstein were put in such degenerate light? The movie may be funny but is not a comedy, therefore the intention was to smear the name of Imhotep. This makers of this movie should be tried and convicted for psychological warfare."
0,Dumb,"Another case where they rely on special effects to make a story scary. Perhaps, they should have invested in a story that would scare someone. Great effects, but the script mixes buffoonish humour with state of the art effects. It doesn't work. Questionable casting as well. this one is a dog, and its mummy's a dog as well."
0,"Silly, silly film","This movie was a fleeting diversion, nothing more. And that's about the only positive thing I can say about it. The story took forever to get started and wasn't even worth waiting for and the characters were insufferable, especially that annoying guy who was in ""Deep Rising"" and the brother of that Frasier's love interest. The movie would've been better if the Mummy had offed him. The special effects are decent, I suppose but they're not enough to make me want to watch this turkey again."
0,Incompatible with Some Blu-Ray Players,"This dvd does not play on my Pioneer Elite BDP-95FD. The machine loads the menus but none of the movie will play. The player has up-to-date firmware and is less than a year old.Might be a great transfer but more care should have been put into seeing that the DVD functioned on all blu-ray players or a warning should have been given about what was needed.Based on other reviews, this problem does not appear to be limited to Pioneer machines."
0,"Fun SFX, but paper thin","Although this movie is a fun ride with tongue-in-cheek dialogue, it didn't bother to get anything about ancient Egypt right. Considering it wouldn't have been that hard to get at least a few details correct, this lack of ANY historic accuracy ruined the movie for me. By the time the characters started talking about ""five canopic jars,"" I couldn't stand it anymore, I had to turn to my date to say ""FOUR canopic jars!"" And, what's ""mummifying people alive?"" Since step 1 of mummification is draining the body of blood, you wouldn't actually live through more than a few minutes of the process. The complete ignorance of Egypt, obstensibly the setting and motivation for the entire film, is extremely grating and offensive. Cute dialogue is nice, cool SFX is nice, but they aren't enough to get me to watch this one twice."
0,The Mummy review.,"I wanted to order the physical DVD sent to me and I went into the wrong place. I did not want the video showing on my computer. Therefore, I deleted it right away."
0,Poor Transfer,"I just watched my Blu-Ray version of The Mummy and was very disappointed. The definition was almost indistinguishable from the DVD! If you're looking for eye-popping high resolution, this movie doesn't deliver. It looks like standard definition. Don't believe me? Try it yourself. Bummer."
0,Indiana Jones?,"It wasn't horrible but I found myself dosing off in the theater while watching it.It reminds me of what an Indiana Jones movie would be like if Steven Spielberg wasn't involved in the production! I didn't care for the computer generated appearance of the mummy either. To sum it up,it's a movie that's designed to be ""fun"" not scary and often gets boring."
0,Indiana Jones Meets the Mummy,Boooooo!!! The best part of this movie was (of course) the visual effects.. If only they could find actors who could act and not shoot everything that moved! I'd recommend the origional 'Mummy'---MUCH more thrilling...
0,Bad movie - Good DVD,"This was a reasonably bad movie, and the only possible reason for purchase is to test the excellent capibilities of a DVD player."
0,The won't work,I got this about a month ago and also had bought The Mummy Returns. I just got a HD DVD player in Feb. and it won't play on it or any other I have in the house. They had a piece of paper that came in the movie case and said that you machine may need to be updated. I went to the website and all they have is an announcement saying that they aren't making HD-DVD players anymore.
0,A VERY BAD MOVIE,"Well, this is the one of the worst high budget movie I've ever seen in my life. The ILM digital effects are the only aspect of the movie that is not totaly wrong ... (Bad Acting, Bad script, ...)"
0,Great special effects. . . . . horrible cast,"I rented the Mummy hoping to see a serious movie with awesome special effects. What I got were great special effects, and a mismatched cast. Brendon Frazier (not sure of the spelling) was horrible in this movie. His comedic style completely ruined what could have been an awesome movie. I was expecting an ""Indiana Jones"" type movie, but what I got was Encino Man being chased by a mummy. I would encourage renting this movie for the special effects, but thats about it."
0,BEWARE of this SELLER!!!!,"Beware of this seller. They only shipped 1 of 12 items. They never responded to any of my various emails. I was supposed to receive a 12 pack of post it notes however,I only received 1 pad."
0,One of the worse and most dissapointing,"What you see is not what you get.!!!! You don't get the whole pack but only 1/5 of it which is 100, its a rip off. run for your soul while you can.!!!"
0,its in Spanish!!!!!,"Yes, I had the same problem and it is not mentioned anywhere that it is in Spanish until you get in your hands. I do realize that Las Rubias De 5th Avenue, does not exactly sound English, but knowing the author, I totally thought she is just being fancy!"
0,I thought that it was written in English,"I didn't realize that it was written in Spanish until it was too late. The cost of return, since it was my own responsibility, would be more than the book(I live in Tokyo)."
0,Made the same mistake.,I never ever thought that a book would be placed on Amazon.com and when not publihsed in English be made more emphatic. The book looks good but of course I can't read one word of it. I live in Australia so to send it back will put me out more than keeping it. Very frustrating but what can you do? Now I always check that the book I am purchasing is in English. By looking at the prior customers who had the same problem I don't feel as it I was the only one caught out with this book - Spanish who new?
0,"Say It Ain't So, Martha!",I will not be reading any more Emma Graham mysteries by Martha Grimes. I was very disappointed because the book did have the same quality writing as in ms. Grimes' Richard Jury novels. It would have been more generous to have described it as children's literature.
0,Disappointed in the packaging,"The book was wrapped with a thin bubble wrap and scotch tape, then covered with brown paper. The postman left it on the front porch in the rain and the book was ruined. I through it away."
0,Didn't last long,"We had a prior Grohe model for many years that finally gave up the ghost. I called Grohe customer service and they were unwilling to repair or sell replacement parts. The only choice was to replace it.We wanted to stick with Grohe design to blend with the faucet, so we ordered this.It lasted not much more than a month. Too long to return to Amazon and it's probably not worth my time with customer service."
0,Ordinary novel from overpraised author,"My second attempt to like Seymour, as did my first, failed.The reviewers who compare Seymour to LeCarre and Greene surely cannot have read much of either. Seymour is more a writer of thrillers, more Clancy-like,than either LeCarre or Greene. Both of the latter write something very close to literature; Seymour (or Clancy for that matter)never come close to that level. His plots are intriging, even at times exciting, but his people portraits rarely more than caricatures."
0,not good,"I have had my nose pierced for years and I am pretty used to purchasing nose pins/rings like this but I have never been so dissapointed. Had I known that the quality of this piece of jewelry was going to be so low I would've saved my $10.99+expedited shipping, spend a little more and got a real nose pin. The last nose pin I had got old and was due for a replacement, I found this one and bought it but as soon as I got it I thought this must be a joke because it was by far the smallest nose ring I've seen (it wouldn't fit my sister who has a small nose).I have never been dissapointed by bodycandy before so don't let this review reflect your opinion of their company or service. I always receive my orders quickly and I have never been dissapointed with their jewelry before but this piece was laughable."
0,Bad,"Nose earring was too small to put in my nose, and as i was trying to put it in, the little rhinestone came out of the earring. I need to return."
0,This game is the pits,"The game has too many bugs, frequent crashes and majority of the time even when you have all your information you can not obtain required search warrants etc. DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY on this piece of garbage"
0,Needed an exterminator for all the BUGS!,"Slap my wrist for buying this game new. I should have waited 6 months. I couldn't find any support online for the bugs and when I finally got everything working, I forgot to turn my virus software off (plus you can't have a screensaver on either & you have to turn off background animations & shadows within the game) and it jacked up my computer BIG TIME. Wait awhile for them to fix this before buying it unless you like being ticked off."
0,WASTE OF MONEY!!!,I was so excited when I found out that they were coming out with Law & Order Criminal Intent but it turned out to be a BIG dissapointment. After installing the game and watching the beginning scene the game just stopped working after that. The entire screen was black and all I saw were the characters. I know I have the latest version of Direct X because all of my Sims games require it but that didn't matter the game still refused to work properly. Save your money and buy yourself something thats actually worth it!
0,Wish I hadn't spent $30 bucks on it,"I LOVE Law & Order. I watch the show all the time and I have the other 3 games that are currently out. I've played them all. Each generation of games seems to get a little better in regards to the programming and manueverability (I KNOW I spelled that wrong!). This game was a complete disappointment! I experienced almost all the same bugs as some of the other reviewers mentioned.In fact, when holding all the Law & Order games up in comparision to the CSI games, they are seriously lacking in both enjoyment and graphics. I would recommend all the CSI's to anyone who even remotely liked these Law & Order games. I don't watch the show, but I love the games. Can't wait until they come out with more! I seriously hope the writers and programmers get their heads out of their butts and start creating the games I know they are capable of!!"
0,I hade to quit playing....,"I was excited about this game coming out because I have played the others and enjoyed them a lot. However, this game had a lot of bugs, jerky movements and crashing....I only solved 2 of the cases and half way through the 3rd one and I stopped playing because of my frustration level.I guess it will have to sit on a shelf until Legacy figures out how to correct all the ""bugs."""
0,Too many bugs!,"Although I was able to play the first two games in the series without problems, and although I have updated drivers, and my computer meets all of the necessary requirements, I couldn't get past one minute of game play without the game freezing or shutting down. Way too many bugs and no support online. I would avoid this one."
0,Bugs and Frustration Await You,"I'd never played the Law & Order series games before this one, until then I had played only the CST series so that was all I had to compare it to. While Law & Order does a good job of trying to distinguish itself from CSI - one way it does this is by requiring the player to choose a ""tone"" in which to interview suspects (sympathetic, interogation, straightforward, etc.) thereby varying the level of information you get out of the suspects. Even this, however, becomes tiresome after a few suspects and a few questions.This game is so filled with bugs that it is too frustrating to even play. One bug is that when directing Detective Goren on where to walk, he often gets ""stuck"" and will jog in place or worse, jog into a wall repeatedly rather than go where you are directing him to go.All in all this game is too frustrating. Save your money."
0,Oh the Agony . . . .,"I was very excited about this game but after TRYING to play it I was just as excited to uninstall it and play something else! Grissom sounds like he is about asleep, he walks into walls, disco dances and what's up with all the characters standing up and flinging out their arms? Is this a secret society or something? Sometimes the people disappear all together. Where do they go? Not to mention locking up frequently (and yes, my system does meet the requirements!) If I hadn't paid good money for this, it would be comical. I'm sure the story line is good, but I won't try or buy another L&O game until there are patches. Sorry."
0,Bugs destroy this game!!!,"I'll keep this short and sweet. Do not bother wasting money on this game. Bugs completely destroy the playability and enjoyment of this game, and the developer still has not addressed it! The game has been out for 4 months as I write this, and they still haven't taken any steps to fix it! Other reviewers say patience will get you past this. Baloney! Why would you play a game with huge glaring flaws? Supporting the developers of such games just encourages them to release shoddy flawed games before they're finished in order to cash in on them! Stand up for your rights and don't purchase this garbage!"
0,Stick with the CSI games,If the TV show games are your thing then I recomend sticking with the CSI Las Vegas games. They flow better and the stories are far more interesting.
0,game issues,"Amazon was fast with sending my game to me. I love these games, but the game itself has many issues. The video is really bad. It's not my video card my husband has checked to make sure of that. I have just about every other Law and Order games and also CSI ones. They are the best."
0,Crash-o-rama,"After 3 months I finally completed all four cases. I had to step awaaaaaay from the computer many many times to avoid throwing it out a window. I know, I know, don't kill the messenger. The game would be wonderful if not for the fact that it randomly CRASHES and every footstep has to be saved or potentially lost forever. Legacy sucked every ounce of fun out of the Law & Order series with this one, but my own sheer determination made me finish the cases. I hope they fix the problems with the next one. I think I'll read the reviews before buying it."
0,Please save yourself the aggravation!,"I am not new to adventure gaming and have a PC fully loaded and capable of handling EVERY other game I've tried. This one was so full of bugs that I snapped the CD in half out of sheer frustration. There are no patches available yet for the MULTITUDE of problems. Until there are, please don't waste your money!"
0,Do not buy this game!! Too many bugs!,"I purchased this game recently, and I wish that I had read the reviews first... I have also experienced serious problems with the game. Many bugs... Several(10-15)minutes with a black screen between scenes! I wasted soooo much time attempting to play the game... and then it just completely crashed on me! I would have enjoyed this game if it were not for all the bugs! If it were not for all of the problems with this game, I'm sure that I would have solved all of the cases already... I preferred the CSI games that I purchased last year... and now I have pre-ordered the new CSI 3 game... I hope that there aren't any glitches or bugs like the new Law and Order- peice of crap. What a waste of money!"
0,"Game is good, TOO MANY BUGS","If you enjoyed the other L&O; games, you'll probably like this one too. However, this game has a lot of graphics problems and it's crashed on me twice. I have an nVIDIA GeForce 4 graphics card with 64MB memory, but the game still crashes on me even after I lower the graphics options. When I first got the game I had to call customer support (NOT TOLL FREE) and be on the line with them for over 30 minutes before they figured out that I need to download OLDER drivers for my graphics card.I got this game as soon as it came out becuase I loved the other L&O; games. If you can wait, give them time to fix the bugs and maybe release a patch or two. There isn't even an FAQ on their website for this game yet."
0,There's a reason this movie is out of print,"This has to be one of the stupidest things I have ever seen. The plot makes little sense, the acting is terrible, and it tries to rip off aspects of real ""horror"" movies (such as Amityville Horror's ""Get Out"" and Halloween's music)."
0,A cursory review based on the sample download.,"I found the text to suffer from poor OCR conversion from the original work. To be of value, the author or publisher should proofread the book."
0,egregiously bad,"I agree with the previous reviewer; I 'bought' the full book (as it was free) and found it so full of garbled text & typographic garbage as to make it, for novices, worth its price: nothing."
0,unreadable...there's a much better edition,"yes, this edition is unreadable - BUT there's another, published by d k printworld, and also available on amazonthis is the best of the nineteenth century grammars (and is itself a re-writing of an earlier grammar) - though learning sanskrit needs a good teacher"
0,Not Recharge,"The product is listed as Dial for Men - Recharge, but is actually Blue Grit.Recharge is a great soap, but Blue Grit is not. Have no idea why Dial has changed from a great soap to a bad soap.The Blue Grit also comes as 4 oz and not 4.5 oz as shown.Won't buy Dial again unless the actual recharge soap is offered."
0,What Is That Smell???,"Dial For Men Blue Grit bar soap smells like ass. Fortunately, the smell does not seem to cling."
0,Sex book with too much in-your-face closeups,"This was also used for Bombshell Boobies (only the stories differ): Okay, I thought this was going to be pretty artwork (books like that exist - though rarely - like Manara's Gullivera). Instead, it's a pretty hum-drum sex book using too many close ups and unimaginatively drawn characters (who are techincally drawn okay but look dull) and quiet gross ""flying fluids"" exageration. The stories are the same-ole repressed male fantasy stories you can hear anywhere - although not as original (forbidden fruit gets stale) as some grass-roots stories. Boring. If not stupid. Erotic only to the lame. I own quiet a bit of plain-jane non-erotic mainstream manga and I can only say that there are far better artists with talent both in drawing and layout out there. Indeed, Japanese manga artists are some of the best illustrators I've run across - but not all of them."
0,Disappointing.,"I'm of the opposite opinion of most people who played this game. Unfortunately, I'm a fan of the original, having played it first, while many who have played this game did not have the benefit of the first. I felt that much of the story was ridiculous, turning the series into a farce. Everyone has their right to enjoy it, if that's what they did, but it was not for a die-hard fan of SH1."
0,WHAT HAPPEN?,I love shadow hearts 1-2. God they were amazing. I played part 3. While i was playing it. The grpahics went to Hell. It was a down grade from ther others. The voice was amazing. The battle system was awesome. the story was just not there. the game drags on and on. It was badly written and design. I love 1-2. I still play them on My PS3. I beat this game 2 times to see 2 endings. The second time. I had to force myself to play this. I just dont know why they did a crappy job on this. Just bad.this was bad on every level.Shadow Hearts 1-2 was golden. Part 3 was Bronze. this opinion is mine not others.
0,wasn't in the original case.,"It was in a case from gamestop, that's one of my biggest pet peeves, not having a game in its original case."
0,Meh...,"This game is nothing compared to Shadow Hearts and Shadow Hearts Covenant. I really did not get attached to the characters like I did with the previous games. I enjoyed the bit roles from old characters like Lenny, Roger Bacon, Keith Valentine etc. but they were just that...tiny roles. And the Valentine sister, so annoying. If you really want a good game, play Shadow Hearts Covenant. I could play that game everyday, forever :)"
0,Conuterfeit blades claimed to be original.:(,"The comapny claims these cartiriges are brand new in original box. However, my experience shows the following:1. The cartirges arrived in an opened package which had labels, probably from a retail store, removed from its back. It was obvious that this ""original box"" was previously used2. After using the first blade it felt like I am shaving with sand paper. It was a counterfeit. The top blue layer with soothing gel felt like rubber.3. I went to Target and bought true original blades to compare. The experience with the original blades was smooth and nice shaving."
0,Fusion Power Blades,"I bought these blades and was overcharged on shipping by $28.00US If you check the fraud pictures posted on the internet these fall under the fake category.I bought these for friends and family and i get responses that these blades do not stay sharp. The blue glide strip does not wear like normal ones. No serial numbers, Indent on outside of cartridge that signifies fake blade the metal clip holders not bent down to hold blades secure to cartridge again are being sold as fake.Just not the same shave as authentic blades should be.Not happy with purchase"
0,These blades are not the real thing.,"These blades are not genuine Gillette blades. Comparing these blades to actual Gillette brand ones I bought at the store, these blades have a fake ""indicator strip."" Blades wear out long before genuine Gillette ones do. The plastic molding of the blade is different than the real thing. The packaging is much cheaper than actual Gillette packaging. I would not recommend these unless you're looking for a fake gillette version blade."
0,Where does it end?,"This razor gives a good shave, but, it is really not that much better than the M3 or even the the Sensor. It certainly is not worth the outrageous price Gillette is charging for refill blades. Twice as much as M3 and 3 times as much as Sensor.$ 28.00 for 8 blades? Ridiculous!!"
0,Dull Blades,"I ordered these replacement cartridges and the blades were dull. The first shave was like a blade that I should have discarded. I tried another one, same thing. The price was right, but the shave would have been better with a dull steak knife......."
0,"Close shave, but not as close as the Mach3.","The good news with this razor is that the single blade on the reverse makes a neat job of sideburns and mustache area for men. Unfortunately, this is the only improvement over the Mach3. It also delivers an inferior shave compared to its predecessors.Despite the introduction of the Phantom version, which gives men a more palatable black over the original orange, the shave it gives is still an inferior one."
0,do not buy!,"I first tried the fusion power razor, I thought it was great! But hold on I purchased the replacement blades and WOW! They were terrible!!! they seemed really dull BEFORE I used them. I don't know if Gillette is using the ole bait n switch or what, But my first blade lasted about 3 months and gave a great shave. The replacements are garbage, don't waste your money. Just my opinion."
0,Are these really brand new? or just seconds?,"I've used fusion blades for quite awhile, but these definitely were not as smooth/sharp as usual. They're mostly usable, but not as comfortable as normal. (I threw one away immediately.) I emailed the seller inquiring, but they did not reply."
0,"Rips the skin, but does shave close!","The love of my life has always used this brand of shaver and when this newer model came out we bought it for an upgrade. While it does shave close, for the first time ever my loves skin is ripped and cut up every single time. So you need to think hard before this upgrade. The model just before this new one worked very well."
0,Beware with rust,"Three months ago, I bought 48 Gillette Fusion Power refills (quite an investment), and placed them on my bathroom drawer, and to my surprise, last week I went to replace a cartridge, and found that ALL, literally all, were completely rusted !It's a a shock, and all Mach 3 I had there for longer than that were just like new.How can P&G; can explain that??"
0,Totally disappointed and false advertising,They kept me waiting all this time saying the that they were out of stock and now they cancelled my order. It was false advertising and I would never buy from them again.
0,Too cheap at any price,"This product looked good for the price. Too good infact, think it was a knockoff. Don't waste your money."
0,try the mach 3 or a norelco electric,"This razor system does not give a close enough shave for me. The single blade on the back that is for sideburns and under the nose area does not seem to work at all. They may advertise the Fusion as having the closest shave you can get, but this was certainly not the case for me and I don't think its the case for most people. Also, when I used it my skin became more irritated than it normally does with shaving. I now use the Norelco 8150XL electric shaver exclusively and it works like a charm every time."
0,THEY WILL STEAL YOUR MONEY AND GIVE YOU NOTHING,I ordered this on 09/23/2009 and it is now almost the end of october... I have been had.I love how they take your money and never give you what you pay for. If this is fair then I dont know what fair is. DONT ORDER FROM THESE PEOPLE EVER!!! THIS IS THE ONLY TIME I HAVE EVER HAD A PROBLEM WITH AMAZON.COM. They do a great job and it's sad that this happened.I am not doing business with AMAZON again.
0,Gillette razor blades,I purchased blades from Amazon before but these blades seem to.be very old and scratch the faceI will not purchase again
0,counterfeit blades,"Just opened and tried the first blade. I have been using Fusion Blades since they have been on the market and my face told me with the first stroke that the blades were counterfeit. A convenience store cheapo throw-away blade is a lot sharper. A few years ago I was given a web page that I could buy this type blade at a discount price. They too were counterfeit. I realise that you have to be skeptical when buying on the internet, but I trusted Amazon to have checked their vendors out. What is most aggravating is there was no deal in the price. I could have went to the nearest Walmart and bought for the same price when adding the cost of fuel for the round trip......."
0,It was ok..not as great as I thought....,"I bought the Fusion Power because I am a huge Federer fan and he endorsed this product so I thought why the heck not!! I have a pretty sensitive skin and I thought that this product would work out great for me. I was right. I absolutely loved the product which is why I ordered this replacement cartridges pack from amazon. For some reason though, these blades feel different, and not in a good way. Compared to the blade that came with the razor, these blades are really bad. I still found a way to make these blades work slightly better for me, but I was and am really disappointed. Maybe I got the bad ones or something, but do not buy this pack expecting it to work the same way as the one that came with the razor....."
0,"Rough experience, too many blades too close to each other for thick hairs","I had lost my Mach 3 Turbo, so I decided upgrading to new Gillette Fusion Power with 5 blades. I got thick and hard hairs. These five blades are too close to each other creating a very rough experience like ripping out my hairs and shaving my skin. Tried few times, but kept regretting. Finally, ended by buy Mach 3 Turbo."
0,Disappointed with quality,"The product was received on time but the Gillete blades are not real. They are fake. I am not able to use them, they hurt so much. the blades are not sharp and not aligned properly. they don't have the serial number as the real Gillette blades have. I'll never buy anything from this retailer."
0,Caveat emptor,"These are the best blades you can buy. I usually get two months of shaves out of one blade! Bought some here from Hotdealz and went through 8 blades in 5 weeks. After reading some of Hotdealz responses to negative reviews, I saw they get a little touchy when someone cries ""counterfeit"". I'll refrain from that here. You decide: Normally one blade in 8 weeks. Eight Hotdealz blades in 5 weeks. Hmmm. Not such a hot deal. Let the buyer beware. Stick with a reputable dealer, like Amazon."
0,Fake! Fake! Fake!,These are not the real ones you buy at the store. I bought the exact same package from walgreens and the blades felt completely different.
0,Avoid them,"A rep-off!!! you pay a lot of money to get a bad quality blades. I have tried all the products Gillette produces and unfortunately they all are bad quality so expensive blades. Eventually, I went old school, safety razors are the best you'll every get. try it and you'll say GOD how didn't know about these razors!"
0,Cut Face,"This pack of cartridges must have been laying around in the back yard for sometime. Used all eight in two day's trying to find a good one, cut my face each time I tried a different cartridge. I guess this is one item you don't buy from an online retailer."
0,There are no words...........,It just stinks.... Could'nt even watch all of it. Even the female nudity did not make it watchable...
0,Out of date -- don't buy,This book documents version 1.0.2 of JDK. Sun is up to version 1.3 and has made dramatic additions since 1.0.2. Don't buy something so out of date.
0,Not such a great book.,"If you do not have the javadoc API reference, this book will be very helpful. But this is not the case for most Java programmers. The book does offer things more than what you have in the html javadoc, however, they are VERY limited. As the dynamic html reference gets richer in each 1.1.x release, the benefit of buying this hardcopy deminishes. The samples in this book are largely overstated. They are more of decorations rather than real things.In short, be cautious. If the book description makes you consider buying this book, you'd better find it in a nearby bookstore and read several pages first - to make sure this is what you want."
0,VEry poor reference book,"This book does not worth your money. This is very much like the API doc on the web, there is NO example. Better save your money to find a better ref book such as the Chan & Lee..."
0,Disappointing,"I have been a Delta Force Fan from the First Delta Force 1 game. I found this to be a let down, although there was a slight feeling of nostalgia for about the first 5 seconds of each game. Even after so many years there are game flaws (enemy soldiers that fire through walls - first aid boxes marked on the overview head up display but don't appear in person). I found the game extremely easy too and not in the least bit challenging.... Even the mulitplayer games have very few people on it's servers (you cant even snipe in games where people are using automatic weapons on the Nova games !!!) If I had known how bad this game was I would have avoided it and dusted off my old copy of DF1, it might be dated but it is far more exciting and playable !!!"
0,A poor remake,I've been a Delta Force gamer for many years and have upgraded to almost every new version. This one left me dissapointed. So much so that I don't even play it (have stuck with Joint Ops instead.)
0,An utter disgrace,"As shaman and psychedelic researcher I can honestly say that this is not only not a psychedelics encyclopedia in the most remote sense, but rather an extremely uninformative, incomplete & poorly organized & written yet pretentious 400 page pamphlet. I could not have asked to be more dissapointed by a book with that title, and suggest that no one waste their time money or energy on this book."
0,"I think I had a worse textbook once, ten years ago","The excessive reliance on ML and poor language skills exhibited are well covered in the other reviews. I'd just like to add that Mitchell has a terrible habit of explaining things out of order (for instance, activation records are explained on page 165, but you are expected to know them on page 148), and his ""This is beyond the scope of this book."" handwaving makes many of the explanations completely incoherent.I have never sold back a textbook before, but I'm taking this back to the bookstore right after my final, and then I'll get a real Comparative Programming Languages textbook."
0,Yes it sucked!,"I too took the class with John Mitchell in Stanford a few years back. The manuscript, which now is this book, was very poorly written, erroneous, inconsitent and not even complete! It's one of the worst classes I've taken at Stanford. I believe I could've benefited more from the class had he put students' interest first by choosing a better textbook.I don't know why he put so much empathsis on ML. Had he put some decent effort in helping people actually understand ML, maybe it won't have been so frustrating (back then it was pre-2000, so there weren't many ML material available online - and you haven't heard of Google yet:-). For functional language, wouldn't Lisp be a better example for instructive purposes?Someone in the class at that time suggested him talk about scripting languages such as Perl (Python is now getting interesting). That would be useful comparison. But that was brushed aside.I would not buy this book unless you have no choice."
0,One word -- sucks !!,This is probably one of the worst Computer Science book I have ever read. The author uses ML for most of the examples...which is a pain in the ass. The explanation is vague and examples were not good enough.And you know what? I am using this book simply because I am taking a course with Mr John Mitchell himself.
0,sucks,"Hi, I'm also taking CS242 with John Mitchell, and while I read a review on Mitchell's website calling his book an ""inspiration,"" I've found it to be puke-inducing. He uses a language which nobody cares about -- ML -- for most of his examples, and doesn't do a clear enough job explaining how ML works. As for the class, it too sucks."
0,this is cheap junk,I couldn't even bring myself to give this gift it was so pathetically junky. It should have been $5.
0,Simplified Scientific Astrology,"I am very disappointed in this book because there is no interactive contents. I mean, come on - this is an astrological work tool. I need to be able to go through and index different aspects at different times. I don't doubt that the information is extremely insightful and very helpful (I have a hard copy of this book that I can no longer read due to eye problems) but it is almost worthless to me as it is. The only readon I gave it two stars is because of the wonderful content."
0,What?,"Well, I love the ocean and everything in it and about it. My daughters room is decorated with a ""fishy"" theme. However, I wasn't impressed with this at all! First off, the batteries wear out too quick! And yes, I DID turn it off when she wasn't using it. And yes, I DID use new batteries. Also, the fish that ""swim"" get stuck and don't move and the glitter clumps into one spot. The balls were a hit though! She loves those!"
0,boring and not worth the $$,"This toy looked so cute online but i was very dissapointed once it got here. The fish get stuck all the time, there is even one fish (the biggest) that I cannot get loose from the top of the bowl. There is some kind of ""grate"" thing at the top that the fish's fin fits right into and now will not come lose. There is only one ""song"" if you want to call it that and I find it really boring. My girls 3 and 9m could care less about this toy. they could have done much more with this bowl!"
0,Not a Wonder for us,"This is a very attractive toy. The ocean sounds are so realistic you feel as if you were on the beach. That is my impression. My grandson (10 months) however has a different view.For the first day or so after the toy arrived he would pick the balls up and hold them in his hands while trying to get the little items inside to spin around. However, they would only spin once or twice and stop. He would push the bowl around and listen to the ocean sound for a bit but it was too heavy for him to get it to make the splashing sound. I had to jiggle the bowl in order for him to hear that. He never quite got the ""dropping the balls in the bowl"" part. He would drop them in and nothing, to him anyway, would happen so that ended pretty quick.He hasn't played with it since that first day or two after it arrived.I would not recommend this product unless you are looking for a nice item to put on your child's shelf."
0,Never got his attention.,My son never seemed to take an interest in this toy. I liked the water motion and quiet music. I thought that maybe he would play with it when he was old enough to put the balls in the bowl but again he never played with it.
0,Not very fun!,"This toy was a gift from my daughter's aunt. We bought her duaghter the same toy! I thought she would like it...and she did for about five minutes! All it does is light up and play a song. My daughter plays with the balls more than the actual toy. Not a very good idea. What is the point of this toy? Also, it is extremely heavy, which makes it kind of dangerous!!"
0,BORING,"I bought this toy for my 6-month old for Christmas last year. She really didn't play with it that much. She is now 17 months old, and to this day this toy has not interested her at all. It is still on the shelf, in perfect condition. I've gotten it out for her periodically, but this toy does not appeal to her."
0,Beware - This does NOT shut off automatically!!,"My son received this toy as a Christmas gift. A few days later, I heard an eerie, low groaning sound coming from the playpen long after my kids had gone to bed. It seems that the combination of the fish bowl's very easily activated motion sensor and its lack of an automatic shutoff feature had caused the toy to play constantly until the batteries just died. Now that they've been replaced, my boys are thrilled, but I have to make sure to flip the switch 'off' about ten times a day."
0,Don't buy,This toy is good for a very limited age span. My daughter played for with it for about a month and then became bored of it. It is very heavy for a small child to carry around. This is a toy that looks really neat untill you get it home and realize there's not much to it! Save your money!!!
0,6 months? Seems better for 9+,"I got this for my 6 mth old and all he did was want to put the balls in his mouth. From other reviews I see that babies older than 6 months like it not 6 mth. olds. I don't know why it is labeled for children 6+, it should be 9+"
0,What a shame,"This video had all the makings too be 5 stars, but unfortunatelty it was not remastered in Dolby 5.1 surround, which in this day in age is unexcusable. In fact this video was not even in Dolby 2.0 which was not playable on my surround sound system. I was able too play it on my good old TV speakers though. Yay!!! Don't get me wrong I'm a huge ATR fan but this video was a joke."
0,Poor Quality,"This cheap plastic step-up ring is poor quality. It does not stay on the lens well, and it wants to cross-thread easily because the threads are too shallow. It pops off the lens easily if bumped, and does not hold filters well. It is best to avoid this ring and find a better brand preferably made of metal.I gave this item two stars because it works, it just doesn't work very well."
0,NOT WHAT I EXPECTED,"First of all, I guess It was my fault, I didn't realize it was a DVD. Second ,I didn't think much of it."
0,i didn't like it!,"I really didn't like this game. The steering stinks, The levels stink, and The cars are cool but are pretty slow."
0,Out of his league,"Jerry Rivera does not have the voice nor the ""soul"" to sing the classics of Frankie Ruiz. His sucess is due to his amazing band and great songwriters who have been able to compensate for his short comings as a singer. I'm not saying he is completely horrible, I admit I own his greatest hits album. However, he cannot be mentioned in the same league with the all time greats of salsa, such as Frankie Ruiz. Someone of his caliber should stick to what made him famous, catchy love songs."
0,A well-intentioned but disastrous project.,"Unfortunately, Jerry Rivera does not posess the soul or voice of the late Frankie Ruiz so this tribute CD (while well-intentioned) is disastrous. His cover versions of Frankie's classics ""Desnudate Mujer"",""Tu Eres"", ""El Camionero"" and ""Separemos Nuestras Vidas"" are ludicrous at best. Frankie was one of the 1980's and '90s best salsa soneros and Jerry Rivera is quite simply NOT in his league."
0,How do you get the feet off,"I have one, but the batteries corroded the metal connector. How do I get the feet off, so I can replace the contacts? Any advise is appreciated. Tx"
0,babyish robot toy,casey is the dummest robot toy. hes kinda handsome. hes way dummer than see and say. hes really fat. hes so ugly he dosent have a girlfriend. i dont know why he always teaches dumb stuff. i dont reccomend this because its so babyish
0,My boys don't play with Kasey,"My son received this as a Christmas present when he was 3. I also have a 5 year old son. My 3 year old has never shown any interest in this toy. My five year old has played with it briefly about 2 times. Kasey sits and collects dust in our toy room. I feel bad that Grandma paid so much money for a toy that has not been used by either of my boys. My boys enjoy educational computer games and I think Kasey was a little boring for them compared to the computer. To be honest, I found him a little boring compared to the educational software that we have as well!"
0,Kasey has been shelved..,"I gave this toy a 1 star for fun because no one in my house and neighbors has played with it for more than a couple of minutes, Except my 4 year old son battles Kasey and the Fisher Price Resuce Hero robot URV. My 3 year old daughter was fasinated with the display at the store. Trying to avoid buying her more Barbie products, I thought this would be a good choice. It turns out, she is not that interested in its wonderful capabilities. Santa even velcroed a pink bow to his head to feminize it. Oh well, mom enjoys Kasey's humor, but my childrendo not."
0,If you like loud commercials you will like this toy.,"My 3 year old son received one of these for his birthday. We were excited to try it out but right away there was a problem. When Kasey spoke the ""learning"" part was quiet but all of a sudden it made these weird sound effects that were extremely loud. The sound effects are so loud that they make you not even want to play with it and the educational parts you practically have to lean in to here. And if that wasn't bad enough when you don't push a button fast enough it gives you attitude. I honestly don't know what they were thinking when they made this one. If your child wants a robot don't buy this one. If you are looking for an educational toy buy a LeapPad or something else."
0,DON'T BUY THIS ITEM,"Don't buy this item....I juSt bought it and can NOT get anyhting for it because Fisher Price has DISCONTINUED this item as well as ALL of the cartridges!!!! I paid FULL price ($59.99) for this item and 2 ($19.99/EACH) of the 5 cartridges that were offered. When I called Fisher Price I was told ""Sorry Ma'am, there is nothing I can for you"" They have my money so they no longer care! DON""T BUY THIS KASEY KINDERBOT!!!!!!!!!"
0,Ignore the hype. This isn't a great toy.,"If you already have a Pixter or a LeapPad, this toy won't win your child's preference. If you don't have a Pixter or LeapPad, get one of those instead.To begin with, the thing is ergonomically ridiculous. This toy stands on the floor and has four buttons on the front that your child is supposed to push to make things happen based on what's on the screen. The screen is a cheap, dim LCD that's hard to read unless your child lays tummy down. In which case pushing the buttons is awkward and tends to knock the toy over (or at least make it slide backward). That gets tiring, so they won't play long.Our kids quickly decided that the best fun they could have was randomly pushing the buttons. For a while. Pixter and LeapPad, meanwhile, are still being used...."
0,could definatly be better......,"My 8yr old daughter LOVES legos. She was so excited to find a girls lego watch. She saved her money and waited anxiously for the watch. Unfortunatly it does not stay on well, is not designed for little wrists, and is very bulky. She wants to wear it, but it falls apart a lot."
0,Poor quality,"I bought this for a Christmas present for my niece and ended up returning it. At first, I thought maybe some of the pieces were missing from the package as it appeared to have been previously opened, but I don't think that was the case. It just looked really cheap so I returned it and got a Timex with a butterfly-theme band. She loves it!"
0,Smaller than I thought,"This came within 3 days of ordering seperate from other items with free super saver shipping.Although the tiger is very cute, I was expecting it to be bigger. I should have looked more carefully at the measurements. :/"
0,Book has still not been received.,I ordered the book on 06 December 2008 and today is 14 January 2009 and has still not received the book. I have sent three emails to the seller without any response. This is frustration especially when my class has already started.
0,Ug!,"On late nite TV on a B channel where it deserved to be. No recognizable plot. while the premise is two opposing spies involved in a joint prisoner trade who get double crossed, it is not an action movie, it is barely a buddie movie, and it is certainly not a suspense movie. The double cross is explained weakly. Some of the scene set ups were just stupid. It just repeated the same shtick over and over - spy buddies move from one location to another, bad spies chase them, spy buddies escape in a not really exciting way--- next scene."
0,Baryshnikov and Hackman save the day,"I watched this despite bad reviews because I really wanted to see Baryshnikov in a feature film like this. And he does a great job. I'm wondering why Hollywood never offered him more roles like this over the years, since he's really quite good at it. Despite the chemistry of the actors, the movie is just very hokey and pointless. They try to make the story interesting by alluding to the extent of corruption within the U.S. government, but I think that's all common knowledge these days and not really that shocking anymore. I was amused throughout the movie that the CIA and Russia were upset about losing 2 million dollars, because I kept thinking of scenes in Austin Powers when everyone is laughing at Dr. Evil for thinking 1 million dollars was a lot of money... In short, this movie was just kind of juvenile and nothing extraordinary. Baryshnikov fans should be pleased though."
0,Hugely biased.,The authors use of words make the British Redcoat seem foolish and weak. If this book is meant to be about the battles of the revolution then why are all the American victories listed and yet not all of the British ones? Makes no sense to me seeing as the British won most of the battles.If you want to read a 'false feel good propoganda' type of book then feel free to go for this one BUT take everything you read with a massive pinch of salt. It's these type of books that have completely churned factual history into a euphoria of false patriotic rhetoric.Rebels and Redcoats will provide you with a far more comprehensive and factual base from which to look at the war from.
0,Revolutionary War Battles,I was very disappointed upon receiving this book from Amazon.com. I had seen it at Barnes & Noble bookstore and was looking forward to having my own copy as an addition to my home library. The book I received was a paper back book which I was aware of but the Amazon.com description did not describe it as a pocket size book. I do not buy pocket size book for my home library cause I do not enjoy using them for reading or research work. The book would have been much more helpful if it had more table information and list as well as biographical information for the leaders of the battles. Chapter outlines or summaries would have been a real plus also. I wish I had bought the larger copy at the higher price at Barnes & Noble bookstore. You get what you pay for.
0,Battles Of The American Revolution,"I don't profess to be an expert on the American Revolution, however; I do specifically know enough about the northern campaign to realize that the Battle of Hubbardton did not occur in the State of New York as the index indicates ( "" Hubbardton, NY: battle at, 139-40"" ). It is the only revolutionary war battle fought within the State of Vermont. To me, such an obvious mistake puts the rest of the book's accuracy in question. Based on that alone, I won't buy it.P.S. In order to post this opinion, I had to rate this book. In all honesty, I would normally not have put a rating since I haven't read it. Sorry..."
0,Warning: Copy-Controlled!!!,"This apparently is a ""Copy Controlled"" by EMI CD. Great.Any CDs I buy these days, I personally tend to rip to mp3s so I can listen to on the portable player I use. Oh well. Won't work on things like many car CD players, either.Buyer beware. 5 stars for Madredeus and their music. F- for the music industry pulling stunts like this that harm the average consumer's personal use while the ""bad guys"" get around things regardless.If only they'd spend more time and effort finding and developing more acts like Madredeus in the first place.Don't buy this particular version unless you're ready for some hassles. Ugh...."
0,Boring Toy,"None of my 3 kids liked this toy. They simply did not care! I think a regular ball is more fun than this. If you leave it on and it's tippped ever so slightly on the sensor part inside, it will sit there and go off everytime you walk by it. OY."
0,Just don't do it,"Massive, Zebra is one of the hottest artists in the dancehall right now, but this album flops. Only two songs on this album are decent (The first song and the last). Massive, you'll do alot better just buying a compilation cd with Zebra and other artists. A big disappointment, trust me."
0,SAVE YOUR MONEY,"This book was a total waste of time and money(well time, is sent it back). It gave a very cursory level explanation of all internet concepts and provided very little depth. If you have no idea how the internet works this may be a good book, otherwise buy something a lot more technical. Not written by microsoft press!!!!"
0,Neil Simon did this?,"Don't even think of buying this DVD for a buck and a half, new or used. The film is a turkey, a television attempt to revive a failed play. Imagine a Neil Simon play without a single laugh, without a semblance of wit, without a glimmer of insight into the human condition. And you have London Suite. Why go into the details of the story? It isn't Plaza Suite or California Suite. If you think the agonies of a man with a bad back are funny, this is made for you. Poor Madeline Kahn, being reduced in her mortal illness to taking a part in this disaster."
0,Incorrect construction,"I have bought almost 8 shirts from this manufacturer. This particular model has problems. Firstly, the sizes are not true (actually somewhat larger than indicated). Secondly, the sleeve construction is about two sizes smaller than the size indicated. I agree with the previous reviewer on this issue."
0,"Nice material, sizes are inconsistant","I ordered a black and a navy XXL shirt.The black was slightly larger than a normal XXL, but is wearable.The navy XXL chest size measures approximately 62 - 64 !!!This is larger than many 4XL shirts I have seen. And is no where close to the generic sizing chart that Amazon provides.For both shirts to be from the same manufactuer and line and to be completely different in size makes me leary to purchase clothes from this manufactuer again."
0,"If you love God, don't buy it.","I was looking for a book with different short plays in it for my 3 children. This I bought without having a review, so I didn't know what sort of plays it were! I started to read the first play; The older Mary: Jesus, I don't understand how you get so many Holes in your clothes. Jesus :Oh, I snag them on the tools in Dad's workshop. ? You don't learn your children this way the Bible. Their was one play about how Santa Claus came to earth. From St. Nicolas an archbishop in Turkey, this play we liked, so the only reason why we want to give it 1 star , because we always celebrated st. Nicolas on December 6, in Holland."
0,Special Forces,"I've been a Mortal Kombat fan for many years now. I'm always excited about new Mortal Kombat releases. However, this game really disappoints. The gameplay is just too simple and the story lacks depth. Believe me save your money for something better. Subzero mythologies was way better."
0,just plain horrible,"Definitely the worst game of the MK series. This one is not worth even this low price. Save your time and money and play a real game like Metal Gear instead. I have to disagree with the previous reviewer, MKM was a masterpiece compared to this."
0,"This was NOT a Steven Seagal type dvd I, liked !!","I, choose a 1 star rating because it was NOT the kind of TRUE Steven Seagal DVD I like, it's more like Sci-FI.I, would only recommend to people who like Sci-Fi DVD's, but not to people who expect to see Steven Seagal in ACTION."
0,get it right,I was wondering why this one still states it is a Seagal DVD.. Buyers beware... read the reviews...I didn't and ended up giving this one away. It wasn't worth sending back.
0,The single worst film of all time?,"It gives me no pleasure to write the subject line, above. I love Steven Seagal films. They tend to be exciting, have some snappy dialogue, and often have great villains (Henry Silva, Basil Wallace).But let me digress for a moment. In the 1970s, there was a film, The Green Berets, that was called ""the worst film of all time."" I watched it recently and it wasn't half bad. After all, it had The Duke and Aldo Ray in it. No, this Seagal excuse for an environmental diatribe is insulting to environmentalists, to oil companies, to Alaskan natives, and to horses!It portrays the Alaskans as so dumb that they claim horses came from the western hemisphere (they were introduced by the Spaniards).I tried watching it recently, and could not finish it. It was just too dumb.My recommendation: stay away. Watch Fire Down Below instead: good story, GREAT music, and good red-necky villains."
0,Moon in my Room?,"The text fights off any sensible reader and answers the question, ""If kids are afraid of bears, what are bears afraid of?"" with a simple example: cloying rhymes.Illustrations are very cute, making me wonder if this was designed as a TV show that didn't quite make it to the tube."
0,Poor quality.,The suction cup did not stay on the wall and the radio did not work. The light never goes off.
0,0 stars not an option,hung for less then 5 min. fell. it was broken in the package. listen to the reviews. worst item ever its my 2end one. dont buy pos
0,0 stars not available,"This mirror sucks. First use, fell two times and fogged over. Do not purchase! Did not try radio, what's the point."
0,"Awful, cheap and breaks instantly","This is the worst product I've ever seen.The ""mirror"" isn't really glass - just shiny plastic. The radio's volume is almost non-existent and the knobs break off as you take it out of the package.Awful product. Do not purchase!"
0,junk,"A so called ""fog-free mirror"" that fogs within minutes of the shower running.The clock is terrible and keeps horrible time, within days it will lose hours or add hours, have to constantly reset it.The light doesnt even work, press the button and nothing happens.The only thing that was working properly is the radio but that didnt long as the whole unit fell off the wall thanks to the junky suction cup, now nothing works and the unit receives no power."
0,"Nothing works, no light no radio. What a waste.","This product is a waste of time. Out of the box and nothing worked. No lights, no radio. Now that I read the other reviews I see this is not uncommon. I will not perchase Totes products in the future."
0,Fog free mirror,"I really like the radio part of this, but the fog free mirror was definitely not fog free. As soon as I turn the shower on it would fog almost instantly. I ended up having to take the batteries out because the light that was suppose to auto shut off would stay on constantly."
0,It's OK,"The ""lighted"" feature is completely useless. The light is aimed wrong and doesn't illuminate anything. Though the mirror is good with fogging, it isn't a very good one.The LCD Clock and radio is a good touch, unfortunately I don't use them.Maybe the makers should've just concentrated on the mirror....maybe made it magnifying or just a little bigger."
0,Don't waste our money.,"I bought the mirror at about $30.00 for a Christmas present for my husband. The suction cups kept the mirror up for about a few hours after that it kept falling off the wall. The clock broke because it fell. Then we hung it a different way and not even a month later it is like a regular mirror. It fogs, what happen to fog less mirror!?! This is a rip off. Don't buy it. It looks like it is cheaper that in the picture. Total disappointment!"
0,barely functional. barely,"The mirror works. It is fog free.The clock does not work. It resets every time the radio is turned on and off.The radio is barely functional. It only picks up the radio station that has a super-strong, super-close signal. 95% of the local radio stations cannot be picked up."
0,Cheaply made.,"Seems like a great product, but after recieving the first one. The FM radio didn't work and the light didn't work. The second one I recieved as a replacement, the radio worked, but still the light did not work. I was tired after this time and settled. My husband took it apart and fixed the light, but it wouldn't seal completely after closing, so he had to put tape around it. Wasn't worth all the hassle."
0,Do not purchase!,"My husband has been wanting a fog free mirror to shave in the shower for so long....I decided to purchase this on because it has a light, radio and clock included...good deal right? WRONG! The mirror is ok...but everything does not work. It's not worth anyone's money. Please dont make the same mistake I did."
0,Worst Piece of Garbage I ever owned,"This is the first time i have ever written a review, but this piece of garbage is so bad, i had too.I Received this as a xmas present. The suction cup fails occasionally, and when it falls, things break on it. The batteries wont stay properly seated in the compartment, so i gotta smack the hell out of it to get the light on. The radio, used to work til it fell.But those are just novelties, i really cared about the mirror itself. Fog Free? are you serious? that lasted about a week, now it gets so fogged i cant see anything in it.. DONT buy this POS."
0,Dont' Buy,"Can be knocked off the suction cup and if it falls will break.DON""T Buy - at some point the suction cup or it will get knocked down and then break into 100 pieces"
0,Does the term...waste of good plastic mean anything?,"The worst product. Put the batteries in and I thought the on/off button was going to fall...off! No radio, no light, but hey, the digital quarter inch clock was flashing! Went to turn the AM-FM knob and thought holy crap! I need to go to the gym to turn this switch, but felt better moving the radio knob, it only requires you to bench about 400 pounds!"
0,Big Suprise,"My bottle of L-Carnitine 500 just arrived. 90 capsules. Here is the statement on daily dosage: ""2 capsules 3 times daily."" So I have a 15 days supply and I have to remember to take six capsules throughout the day."
0,powernutra,I saw no results from this product.I dont really like trying to take something an hour before a meal .Busy people dont have time to watch the clock before eating.
0,After two weeks experienced no benefits,"Saw this product advertised as a useful weightloss aid, supported by a report on the Dr Oz TV show. However, after two weeks of using this product, I found no benefit whatsoever. I will continue until the capsules have all been taken, although I think it's just another scam in the mega-million dollar 'weightloss' industry. I would suggest you do not waste your money on this product (although it was inexpensive)."
0,No cigar,This seemed to give little or no benefit. I switched to NOW brand Acetyl-L Carnitine. I really did notice a difference. I would suggest doing a Google search.
0,Be carefull if you want buy this product,"Be careful if you want to order this product because Amazon has not existence of it, although it is offered in 2 or 3 weeks. I placed my order in March (two months ago)and never arrived. Finally Amazon cancelled my order. What can I do?"
0,Junk. Must be knockoffs,"I regret ordering these as a box in the Gillette container was only a few bucks more. From normal packaging I get 30-45 shaves before the razor begins to scratch my face. These...2-3 shaves. Yeah. The lubricating strip at the top disappears after 2-3 shaves too. Really, sorry I bought these. I'll switch back to buying the razors in the Gillette packaging for next time. 8 razors from Gillette has in the past lasted me close to a year, not 12 weeks."
0,Fake Product,"Please be aware that these blades are not official Gillette blades and that they will only last for one week each before they are blunt. Overall, since the official Gillette blades last for a month, we are all better off financially bying the official ones in a standard shop. My 2 cents."
0,Questionable Quality,"I am not sure what it is, but these blades seem to wear out faster than the ones I buy from grocery stores. I thought I'd get some genuinely good blades since they were in these 'factory packs', but I guess they are not. I will going back to buying from the store and when someone does come with a better blade, I will drop Gilette altogether"
0,Less expensive elsewhere,"Amazon used to carry good deals on these 12-packs. No more. It is now less expensive to buy these at Walmart. Also, I would echo the concerns voiced by others that the quality of these blades aren't up to snuff with the store-boughts."
0,Are these authentic?,"I am not sure these blades that get sold in Amazon (or Walmart and Safeway for that matter) are authentic. Or they are a inferior quality. I have found the same blades at Kroger to be great or ones that come packaged with a promotional body wash etc (those are likely authentic). I am not sure what the deal is, but there is something fishy!"
0,Fusion,"Did not received the product, so I can not provide a review! Can not rate the item either, but had to select something?"
0,Ripped Off,This situation goes back to September 2010!! THIS PURCHASE DEMANDS A SUBZERO PRODUCT RATING.The 12 Gillette Fusion Blades were copies not made by Gillette. DULL AS A HOE!! When I contacted Amazon I was told that the money that I paid would be refunded and a new cartridge of GILLETTE blades would be sent. (Email Documentation is available..) As of this date none of the promises has been met.Be careful about your purchases!!!I'm through with Amazon.-- Don --
0,This is not the best a man can get.,These razors are entirely too much money to be this bad. They are dull and scratch the skin... all of them did. The Mach III's I got from Costco were way better. Not going to buy these again.
0,BEWARE,"uSED THE MACH 3 FOR YEARS, SWITCH UP THE M5 BLADE...WORST MISTAKE..OVER ENGINEERED THE BLADEDS CLOG UP...DO NOT BUY"
0,It has 5 blades. Who cares?,"They are constantly looking for new ways to increase the cost of shaving. All they can do is add more blades. From one to two to three to four to five blades. What is next? I would imagine a 6 or 7 blade shaver. Then 10 or 12. It is utterly absurd. Save your money. You can get a nice close shave using a one blade, cheap disposable shaver. Just take your time and be careful. You'll save hundreds of dollars, though."
0,Glad I didn't pay for it,"I had a Fusion handle and blade sent to me by the Gillette company to try. I have to say that I am thankful I didn't pay the premium cost they are asking for this product. It was the most uncomfortable shave I've ever had next to dry-shaving. The idea of the single blade on the reverse side for ""precision"" is only useful because the five blade side is so bulky it can't be manipulated well enough to give a clean line for sideburns or under the nose.Immediately after my shave I had a five o'clock shadow, which was promptly cleaned up by shaving AGAIN with my Mach 3.What's next from Gillette? 20 blades to remove the first layer of skin and gouge out the hair folicle? Perhaps reshape your jaw bone to give you that ""Executive Look"" ?"
0,Package not sealed,They came in a package that was not sealed. I find this unacceptable and dangerous. I am not even going to try them
0,Painful Experience,"These Razors must be factory seconds. It was painful to use the blades. They were course and hurt my face. I did not get a clean Gillette Shave. Felt like old blades I would have thrown out, but they did have new green ruber indicator strips. I ended up throwing them away. Not the usual Fusion Experience. I tried to order these online because I thought I could save a few bucks. I might still try ordering them from amazon, but never again from these guys."
0,Please do NOT buy - stay away. They are NOT the real deal.,"I bought theses with the hopes of saving some cash and for my surprise it turned out that these razors are cheap Chinese knock off brands.These blades will cut your face and only last about a week - if you are lucky. Even with a new blade you can feel the difference and after you have shaved, take a good look at your face and you will see and feel the pain.Stay away!!!! All those 5 stars reviews are probably Chinese working for the knock off company."
0,I never ordered this,I don't understand why this Gillette Fusion 12 count manual razor was shipped to me because i don't believe I ever ordered it. Regardless i did not want it. This item is currently available from Costco
0,Discount_Drugs_Inc should be removed...,They cancelled the order for no other reason than they didn't like the price they advertised.
0,COUNTERFEIT,"These are, hands-down, undeniably, without a doubt, counterfeit blades.The construction on each blade is cheap, so much that the individual detailing blade does not exist. It is simply a hard edge of the blade housing.Upon using a fresh, clean, new cartridge, it feels like running a rusty can across your skin: scratchy, irritating, cheap.THESE ARE NOT GILETTE.I am seeking what further steps I can take to hold Amazon, LLC accountable for selling me a fake item that poses a risk to my health."
0,GILLETTE PRODUCT ONLINE FAKE FROM CHINA,"AFTER CONVERSATION WITH GILLETTE, I GOT INFORMATION, THAT NON OF PRODUCT SOLD WITH GILLETTE NAME A LEGAL. GILLETTE NOT AUTORIZED TO SELL ANYONE AND DON'T HAVE ANY ONLINE STORES TO SELL THEY PRODUCT.ALL THOSE PRODUCTS ARE SOLD FROM GILLETE MADE IN CHINA AND BEING A BAD COPY/ FAKE PRODUCT.BE WARE AND JUST CHECK BEFORE YOU BUY"
0,"Some are good and may give up early, not lasting long!","Being a long time Gillette razor user, I've come to find out that blades can last either five shaves or as little as three before it starts jerking your whiskers out and leaving me with razor burn. All I can suggest is find a better blade and try using a Schick Titanium blade. I've had as many as 50 shaves from one blade or as little as 30 shaves which is saying a lot because I have one very heavy beard.Gillette; do your homework and come back with a better bullet the put in my razor or get out of the business!"
0,After using this switched to Schick Quattro,I had been using Gillette razors for last 15 years. Every time they came up with better product until this one. The blade life is so short for fusion and that made me try to use Schick Quattro. I have been using the first blade of Quattro for last 4-5 months and blades stay healthy. Quattro is only just a little less comfortable compared to new fusion but stays fresh for much long. I am not switching back to Gillette.
0,not the best,There have been a lot of fake blades going around on the internet from what I understand. I'm not sure if these were or not but I can say that they were not good. The blade was shaky and buzzed when I turned on my razor. (I have the vibrating style) And the blades seemed like they were not in the right place as they felt like they were jagged and cutting me.I can't recommend this product and will go back to buying my razors in Duane Reade or CVS.
0,bad razors,"The blades appear are either defective or bootleg; meaning that they are knock off brands. Possibly made in china somewhere. These are not the real thing, and I want my money back."
0,57Johnnie,Buyer beware. I do NOT believe these are by Gillette. I bought these and they absolutely do not work as well as the real thing. The first thing I noticed was a broken seal on the package. The first cartridge broke in half when removing from the holder. The worst part is that the shaves are terrible. It feels like shaving with a tweezers. It is my opinion that anyone buying these will get ripped off. This is my first rip off when buying through Amazon so I will continue to use them.Note: I previously obtained Gillette Fusion Cartridges through Amazon from DAB and they were fine. These came from toponeenterprise.
0,Something wrong with these blades,Not sure what's up. I have used Fusion blades for several years now; they have been great. Bought 2 packs of 8 from this dealer and they all felt very dull. Gillette replaced 8 of the 16.
0,Bad copies!,"I've been a faithful user of Gillette razor blades and replacement cartridges for many years! But, these replacement cartridges are the worst Gillettes I've ever used! The blades are dull big time, some cartridges have missing blade strips, the lubricating strip is green all the way (not green and white underneath), the orange color of the metallic part surrounding the trimmer is a darker than on my usual Gillette Fusion cartridges! I am pretty sure (200%) that these are copies, bad copies probably made in China! This is unacceptable! I got them from AllTheTimeWholesale through Amazon; I will no more buy my Gillette Fusion replacement cartridges from them! What a scam!"
0,gillette fusion power,"I recently purchased the gillette fusion power cartriages on amazon although they were sent by a private source to my home. These blades were not or near store bought quality,after trying several blades i gave up it was like shaving with sandpaper. the product was pachaged properly, and sealed and did not appear to be knockoffs, i dont know what the problem was but they were not the same as sore bought.I have e-mailed procter and gamble and they acknowleged my e-mail and will get back to me"
0,Fake Fusion cartridges,I wish I could give a negative rating. The replacement cartridges were complete fakes. It only takes 2 seconds to figure out they aren't real Fusion blades. It's like shaving with broken glass. The seller immediately refunded my money though which was nice.
0,Something's Not Quite Right,"Either Gillette puts in their best blades into the the handle package, or these are fakes, but they do not work half as well as the original blade I got with the handle."
0,Be very careful,Be very careful - I ordered it and I am sure I got counterfiet. Amazon was nice and refunded but if you suspect something wrong report to Amazon.
0,FUSION BLADES,I have been using gillette products for 40 years. These Fusion blades do not klast 5 shaves the green strip turns white and the blades are not that sharp. You get about 5 good shaves and then forget it.I am moving to an electric shaver because these blades don't last like previous blades from 2 years ago that Gillette made.They are expensive and they do not give yu many shaves.
0,CHEAP KNOCK OFFS THEY HURT,These are fakes. They make look like them but they are not. If you go to your local store you will get blades that don't rip apart your face!
0,The Mail Ate It...,I know these razors work great but they just never came. Got my refund though nice and easy. Seller wasn't sure what happened either. Guess the mail ate it or something.
0,"These may be factory knock-offs, buy direct from Gillette","There seem to be a lot of concerns that these may be factory seconds or knock-offs -- I found 8-packs direct from Gillette on their shop.gillette.com website for about $3/each, guaranteed to be factory originals. I'd be wary of buying these bulk razors from Amazon..."
0,Too expensive,"These blades shave me well, but only last me 6 shaves at the most.After one year's use, this would cost me about $180.I have therefore bought a high end electric shaver for the same price.I only shave with these for special occasions.Easy!"
0,"Sorry, but these were the worst blades ever!",I bought two packs from Save-a-lot. I'm sorry to say but these were the worst blades I've ever seen.The clip broke on over half of them and the blades were dull. It was like they pulled the hair out instead of cutting. I will NEVER order blades on-line again.
0,FAKE BLADES - OUCH!,"These blades are fakes. You will know instantly as soon as you try to use one. OUCH!The real blades are awesome, but I haven't found any real ones online. What kind of world are we living in today?"
0,Defective Lubrastrips,"I had previously been very satisfied with this product, but my first, and only, 4-count package from Amazon had defective ""Lubrastrips"" that curled, leaving sharp edges that could cut facial skin -- and did. The strip was still mostly green, indicating that it should have been good for additional shaves. The strips on all four blades in the package curled and one fell off. Perhaps there is a manufacturing difference in the blades sold here versus in stores, or perhaps it was just a bad lot. I would've given the blades I purchased in stores five stars for sharpness and longevity.See the user loaded photo of a blade with a curled strip (if Amazon hasn't removed it, again)."
0,Gillette Fusion Cartridges shave like they are used and not new,"Gillette Fusion Cartridges shave like they are used and not newI tried several of these from a 24 count purchase and they all feel like just before I toss them for a new one, like they have been used??"
0,Not original blades,Not by Gillete. Do not work as the originals. I have been using Fusion for a long time and I'm sure these blades are not the same that I have used before.
0,Pure JUNK,"Do not trust this vendor, these blades are pure junk. I bought these in September, and finally got around to using them today (I buy these in bulk and these finally got into the rotation). These blades are dull, and do not lubricate the face when used. I suspect these are fake Gillette blades due to extreme poor quality. Since I bought these a few months ago, I have no way of returning these for a refund. So I lost my money on these junk blades. When a deal is too good to be true, it is.DO NOT BUY THESE BLADES, THEY ARE FAKES AND WILL RIP YOUR FACE OFF WHEN YOU USE THEM."
0,Terrible quality,The blades that were provided were poor. They seemed like they were refurbished and felt like shaving with a toothed sawblade. Terrible and of course they are now not returnable since I opened to try them. Tried three blades and all were poor quality. I have used Fusion blades from other stores and they have been fine but not these!!
0,Gillete Fusion replacement blades,"These Gillette blades are substandard They pull your beard and are too painfull to use. Comparing these blades with the same Gillette blades purchased locally I find the following differences: 1) The lub strip from the local ones are much more slippery.The blades purchased on line, they hardly have any lub they appeare to be hard plastic. 2) The orange coating is coming off in large pieces I have never had this happen with the ones purchased locally. 3) The edges on the online ones appeare to have a extra honing process that is not evident on the locally purchased ones. In my opinion these blades are either seconds or knockoffs!"
0,"don't buy these, they will rip up your face",These blades ripped up my face. The blades very rough and hard to use even with lots of shaving gel and prep. These are absolutely worthless. Try something else.
0,The blades I received were fake.,"The blades I received were fake. No serial numbers on blades and the construction was shoddy. Felt like rubbing sandpaper over your face, very painful and very poor shave."
0,Poor Quality,"If I could rate this product less than one star I would. For the price, they are a complete rip-off. I have used this product before and have purchased it from Amazon previously. The color strips on these are orange, when previously they were blue. Even the first shave from these cartridges is uncomfortable. Subsequent shaves are much worse. Do not waste your money. If you like the Gillette brand, spend a little more and buy them from your local store. These are obviously reject products and Amazon should not be selling them."
0,Thought I was getting what I used to buy at the store....,But I must have read the description wrong as I thought I was getting the Fusion Pro-Glide blades. I will use them till they are gone but they are not the same as the Pro-Glide blades nor as comfortable on my skin.
0,Poor Quality,"This is not the same quality i buy from the store, somehow it looks differrent in packing. i tried to save some money but i guess it was not right decision. i should not recomend to buy online"
0,OVERPRICED,Gillette got me. I love the shave of the fusion but the cost of the blades is absolutely RIDICULOUS. It's way out of hand to be paying this much for shaving necessities. DONT get hooked like i did. Stay with your razor.
0,Not Fusion Proglide manual cartridges,"This Gillette Fusion (manual) cartridge currently appears in search results for Gillette Fusion Proglide (manual) cartridge.While it indeed *is* a Gillette product, it's sub par when compared to the Fusion ProGlide manual cartridge."
0,dumb,"I didn't understand The Beginning part. In Cave Cat, there was a dog dinosaur! And there were cave men too! In Sam Spayed, they said bad words and where were all the humans? Everyone were cats! And in The Exterminators, how did the cats talk? Garfield can't talk! Lab Animal was weird and stupid! I didn't understand Primal Self! And in Garfield, Jon said he bought Odie. But in the comic strip, Odie was Jon's roomate's dog and Odie moved in with the roomate. And Space Cat was disappointing because the space thing turned out to be a video game! The book didn't have a good ending. If you want to buy this book, think hard about it!"
0,garbage,Here's an idea: how about we make a 2 sided tape that sticks to everything except what it's supposed to? It sticks infinitely better to fingers and the actual backing of the 2-sided tape than it does to the window sill or the plastic sheeting.At first I was happy that it was so cheap.....and then so furious I wanted to burn the package. never again.
0,Rip off,"This product might work, IF the tape that is provided with it stuck to the wall for longer than a minute. Even with the recommended ""set"" time of 15 minutes, the tape does not stay."
0,"Film is fine, tape SUCKS","As other reviews have indicated, the film works just fine, stretches nice and clear, etc. but the tape is garbage. Do yourself a favor and just buy a roll of 3M double-sided tape if you're going to buy this kit."
0,Installation is awful,"The tape was the problem. The tape that comes with this product did not stick to the window, despite cleaning the surface. It did stick to the plastic, causing the plastic to bunch up. After a long...frustrating attempt at sealing, I managed one window and gave up on the rest. I would strongly caution against this product."
0,This is Crap!!!,"I purchased four boxes of this brand...I will be returning 3!! The one box I am forced to keep, I will need to add another layer plastic of some sorts! This product does not work well! The quality of the tape is a JOKE! The scotch tape my children use for their arts and crafts projects is at least 50% stronger. I am very disappointed in the results I have experienced and would not recommend this brand if it were to only option on the market. Just to make the plastic stick, I have had to use packaging tape! In the process of using the packaging tape, I have ripped the cheap plastic...an all around mess!! Do not waste your money on Frost!"
0,Go with 3M,"I have to agree with naysayers on this one. The main problem, and it's a big problem, is that the tape doesn't stick. I fought battle after battle just trying to get it to adhere to the fixture. Finally, I got it to stick by using some glue as a catalyst. In addition the tape itself was difficult to peel away, and I couldn't get the film itself to shrink by blowing hot air on to it. I don't know what the future holds in terms of removing it once warm weather arrives, but I finally got it. But long story short is that the tape is woefully inadequate. Avoid."
0,"2010 batch worked well, 2011 batch failed","I used this product to cover several windows last year with good results. This year, I bought what appeared to be the same item, packaged in identical boxes. However, the quality was very poor. The plastic sheets were slightly smaller and had a different feel to them, and the roll of tape was plain white and not marked with the Frost King logo like last year's batch was.Last year, the tape stuck tightly to the plastic. This year, it would barely stick. and I had to press it very hard before it would stay. Then, during the shrink-wrap phase, the hair dryer caused the plastic to break almost immediately. It's the same dryer I used on the previous year's batch, and I was careful not to get it too close to the plastic or hold it too long in one spot.Junk. I won't buy the Frost King brand again."
0,Waste of money,The tape that comes with the film is useless. It does not stay on the windows or even to the film. Don't waste your money and buy the 3M brand instead.
0,Better stuff out there than this junk,"We just did 6 windows in our house with the Duck brand from Wal-mart and it worked great! It was our first time ever using a window insulation kit for our windows and it was fairly easy to do. The tape worked really well and we didn't have any issues. So we were at Home Depot and thought we'd buy a kit for the patio door, we saw the Frost King, figured it would be just like the Duck brand we used and so we bought it. After hours of frustration this morning, I have finally ripped it down and threw it in the garbage. What a waste of money, now I will be heading back to Wal-mart to buy a Duck brand kit for the patio door. I hate Wal-mart but it is worth it to use a product that actually works. There tape is much more durable and thicker than the thin stuff you get with Frost King. I don't know how much the kits cost at Wal-mart seeing as someone gave us the insulation kit but it can't be too expensive."
0,The non-stick type of tape.,"Nice piece of plastic. Unfortunately, the tape is WORTHLESS. It's less than half an inch wide, which absolutely won't provide enough surface area to support a sheet of plastic 84"" x 110"", especially if there's a draft coming through the window.Here's the logical issue: If I'm buying an insulation sheet for my window, it's probably because the window isn't sealed very well, which means there's a draft coming through, which means that the insulation sheet I buy needs to come with tape that is sticky enough to be DRAFT RESISTANT. But Frost King's product ISN'T, which means I just WASTED MY MONEY.Thanks, Frost King. I'll be returning this tomorrow and picking up a 3M product instead."
0,Horrible product,"I've been using this product for about four years (because that's all that my local Home Depot sells), always with frustration. The tape is useless. If you're really lucky, it might stick for a half a day. After that, you're using packing tape, and wondering why you spent so much time initially trying to make the whole project look nice.I just ordered a bunch of the 3M tape and plastic, given its far superior reviews. We'll see . . ."
0,NOT A THEARMAL,"These are NOT a true thearmal. This product mught have a purpose for a under the jacket wear, but it's actualy COLD to wear on its own with a T-shirt over it. I tried to sleep in them & it was amazingly COLD when my arms would touch the cold part of my bed, or comforter. I think I was warmer without it. Out in my shop I tried to wear these with a T-shirt on top & it was just FREEZING! My arms felt colder than if I just had a T-shirt alone. It's almost like it does the opposite of what a thearmal should do. Maybe under a jacket or sweater it helps in some way, but I don't like them at all. I feel I wasted my money."
0,Sleeves are way too short,"The sizing runs a bit small, potentially because of the spandex, but one thing that is way to short are the sleeves. I am a 36 chest and 5'9"", and ordered the 38-40 size because the 34-36 sleeves were too short. However, even the 38-40 sleeves are still short by at least a full inch. Get this if you are stout and/or short. Not advisable for slender people as the chest/arm length ratio are not for the slender or even average person."
0,Do not buy.,No thermal value at all. I think I would be better off wearing 2 t-shirts. I work in a cooler all day and the only way I was warm at all was by working harder then normal to stay that way. They do breath really well so if you're sweating you'll stay dry. Great idea in a cooler. So as you move around the breeze from moving passes right through it and evaporates the sweat on you making you even colder. They don't even fit as they should. The bottom is loose and the sleeves are loose and they are tight in the top. I have other thermals that fit very well but these do not. I even went two sizes smaller then the suggested sizing because I new I did not wear an XL as their sizing said I would based on my measurements.Maybe I received something wrong because what I have is a very thin all nylon looking shirt that is about as thick as spandex and has the same slick feel. Nothing soft about it.
0,More like lightweight than medium weight,"The Veritherm underwear shirts we purchased for our son were supposed to be midweight. However, they were much thinner than the midweight shirts we bought at the local outdoor gear store, even though they were supposed to be the same brand, style, etc. Could there have been some mispackaging, or is someone misrepresenting the product? Anyway, if you are looking for midweight polyprop underwear, steer clear of this stuff."
0,Extremely Disappointed,"Was supposed to be a mid-weight thermal. It is a very thin, light weight material with no thermal/insulation capability that I could detect. Also, I'm 6'0"" with average arm length, ordered a Large, but the sleeves are at least 2"" too short. This product, as advertised, is garbage. Not like my old Thermastat Duofolds that I love, and hoped would be similar to this product."
0,Comfortable But Not Warm,"As mentioned in other reviews these are made of very thin material. Consequently I found that they did not provide me with any real thermal warmth when I was stationary. I felt no difference in warmth between having these on as a base layer under clothing versus wearing the same clothing without these while I was stationary. They are stretchy and very comfortable however. My guess is that they would prevent one from getting cold during periods of activity by wicking away any perspiration from the skin. Since I needed something that would be provide warmth during periods of inactivity as well as during time of activity, I am returning these."
0,Definately a baselayer,"I am sure that is what Duofold had in mind is a baselayer.I bought two of these based on other reviews,but these are not what I expected.First they run small.Normally I wear a medium,so I bought a large and it is still very tight.So buy accordingly.Second,I bought these to wear under my work shirts as I am in and out all day long...make note,if the fabric gets cold,so do you.It is early fall here and the lowest temp I have encountered is 40 degrees.I went outside wearing this under my work shirt,the fabric got cold,so naturally so did I.Obviously I did not use the product correctly,as I believe under other layers and a winter jacket,it would probably help a great deal.For my needs,I'll just head back to the old fashioned waffle type long undershirt."
0,Disgraceful,"Bantam was in a hurry to monetize their Nero Wolfe license and did not even bother with a basic proofread. The printing is littered with mistakes. Some are just annoying; others completely confuse and alter the meanings of important sentences. Since the writing is from another time, phrases and phrasings are different; thus it becomes difficult to tell whether a sentence is strange because language has changed or because some idiot at Bantam couldn't be bothered to pull her finger out of her nose long enough to do a classic justice. Possibly the worst offense is that the back cover blurb needlessly reveals a major plot point that happens towards the end of the book. I will NEVER buy another Bantam book again. You shouldn't either. These illiterates shouldn't be printing PennySavers let alone a classic of detective fiction that still sells robustly and enjoys a healthy popularity. Disgraceful."
0,"Stout is great, his reader is abominable","Saul Rubinek, who reads many of Rex Stout's books on tape, is excellent. For my money, he's the best in the business. For that reason, it was with some reservation that I purchased Fer-De-Lance read by Michael Prichard. Would that I had listened to my reservations. Prichard can't read. He has a voice that could sell a lot of Buicks on tv ads between innings on a Sunday afternoon. He should be kept well away from actual prose. Long pauses in the middle of clauses, no awareness of the meaning of the words that come stumbling out of his mouth. My best guess is that Prichard is the result of a bizzare experiment in which he learned perfect English pronunciation but has absolutely no understanding of the meaning of any of the words in the English language, and he sees punctuation as unnecessary decoration."
0,The starting point for all critics of Marx,"This book has some virtues, in terms of clarity of exposition, but as a reading of Marx it leaves a lot to be desired. Like Jon Elster's attempts of making (non)sense of Marx that followed it, this text reads into Marx a set of assumptions taken for granted within neoclassical economics but entirely foreign to Marx's work. If you want to see how Marx and Marxism measure up to the unquestionable and seemingly unthinkable criteria of bourgeois thought, read this. But if you want to understand Marx, read Althusser. 'For Marx' is a good place to start, but be sure to read the essays collected in 'The Humanist Controversy' and 'Philosophy and the Spontaneous Philosophy of the Scientists' too, not to mention 'Reading Capital' and 'Machiavelli and Us' ... Cohen may be easier to read, but only because Cohen doesn't challenge any of the ideology of capitalism that is as invisible to most people as water is to the fish that swim in it."
0,a sleeping pill,"Like other Rhea's books, this one put me to sleep after a few pages. I tried again when I woke up, and I found that Randall's verbose style is poor and technically inaccurate, to the point that his book is confusing at times."
0,It is too thin,"it looks cool, but It is too thin and kind of small. If you want some thing really warm, it is not good enough for you."
0,Poor workmanship,"the materials are very good, but the workmanship is disappointing, at the second wash begins to unpick, I just use it 2 times, materials are thin"
0,Very Small,"Very small product. If you have a small Child, then this will work for them. Normal Adult, pass on it."
0,Balaclava,It works. But is super tight. I wear a large helmet but this is really snug fit. I lost my old one which i believe was cotton and fit better. It fit more like a sock. This one fits like a wetsuit. tight. It smashed my nose down when i ride. Before you buy make sure you want a snug fit balaclava.
0,is not ONE size fits all,"I purchased this after losing my Under Armour Tactical Hood, which fit with plenty of room to spare and was perfect for eating or drinking without needing to remove the whole thing off. When I first pulled the package out I noticed right away that it said ""fits most sizes"" and knew I would have a problem. I tried putting it on and my head had trouble fitting thru the neck area. I finally got it on I noticed the stitching goes right down the middle of your face and the stitching rubbed against my lips and figured it would irritate my lips if worn for a long period of time.If you wear a 7 1/2 or larger fitted hat or have a 22 1/2 inch or larger head I strongly suggest you find another Balaclava as this will most likely not fit."
0,Not too impressed,This balaclava was purchased to use on my 30-40 degree bike rides. It was too tight on my jaw and made breathing distracting. I have a smaller head too. It was not very warm. There is stiching down the center of the chin and is chaffs a bit. Disappointed.
0,Balaclava way too SMALL,"Like other reviewers, I find this balaclava to be way too small. It is definitely not one-size-fits-most. I have a normal sized head and nose, and it fits way too tight on both. One would think they can make a nylon material that conforms to the shape of one's head without being too tight (like Under Armour's products).Oh well."
0,under helmet,"Made in china,it is very thin and poor quality. I do not recomend it.i boght it form my motorcycle helmet ."
0,Garbage,"It is way too tight... I thought it was just me, but I let a couple friends try it and it was way to tight on them as well. It will smash your nose to your face and smear your lips across your face.Purchase this product if you want a flat face with a headache!"
0,Very tight,"Pros: 1) looks really goodCons: 1) I am average guys 5'8"" and it is very tight for me. I have used it for a couple of days and that it. I cannot do anything wearing this."
0,"Way too small, childrens size","I have 2 balaclavas from zan headgear. I bought one years ago at my military surlpus store, it fits great. The one I ordered from amazon.com is significantly smaller. It says one size fits all but that's a lie. False advertisement."
0,"Looks like the picture, but it is paper thin","For the price, what do you expect (I suppose), but there is NO WARMTH in this thing. It is just a CAMO cover for you head while playing in the woods, but that is all it is. It is wafer thin (but decently made), and will provide no environmental protection of ANY kind... so don't be fooled. It is not for Skiing or cold weather protection, just for decoration."
0,tastes nothing like cotton candy,"I have searched high and low for cotton candy flavoring to make cotton candy ice cream. well I happened upon this product and ordered it. When it finally arrived I tried it out in some vanilla ice cream and vanilla yogurt. It tastes nothing like cotton candy and doesn't even have a candy like flavor to it...more of a strawberry. It is horrible and I am very upset since there is no returns on grocery items. If you are looking for cotton candy flavoring that tastes like real cotton candy or cold stone ice cream this is not the product, it is a big let down!!"
0,Anti-Muslim propaganda,"1) Almost nothing about relationship between Islam & Charlemagne;2) No mention of Islamic Renaissance between Haroun Al Rasched and Charlemagne.3) Charlemagne's Aachen Church has Islamic influence, so to deny this is absurd."
0,Fantasies of the Past,"I agree with the other reviewer that this book is dated in the light of later studies, esp. in archaeology and more critical examinations of historical sources. The sole reason for its revival is the current demand for books with an Islamic theme. Otherwise this book would be next to useless. It is more fantasy than fact."
0,"Annoying, and no re-play value","Like many players, I found the disk changing aspect quite annoying. Also, the graphics, for requiring as much hardware as they do, were rather poor. The LoL:GoD graphics were better, and that's sad, since it came out years earlier, and they were worse than the ones in the first game! Also, I don't think the game setup is all that fun; the guild idea would be cooler if you couldn't join every one. Like, if you had to give something up to play the game through, thereby creating re-play value. As it stands, LoL3 should have gone through more review sessions before being published. Westwood, have you ever heard of beta testers?"
0,Not that good,"Just the top part vibrates; the bottom part of the brush does nothing. Also it just vibrates not rotate or spin. I feel like it does nothing more then give a nice hand massage. It is just like a normal toothbrush, but heavier and eats battery. Not worth even this cheap price."
0,Very Expensive Sports Bra,I purchased this item because I read some great reviews on it and because I needed a really good supportive jog bra. I was not happy about paying over $50.00 (with shipping) but I figured it had to be top of the line for that price. I received my bra and it was basically an overpriced sports bra that you could buy at your local walmart. It was very uncomfortable and it was huge. I had to check the size to see if I received the correct one. I don't know if I received the wrong product but I was shocked to read the reviews and then to get such a low quality item for such a high price. Between shipping and returning it cost me $15.00 and I still have no jog bra..ridiculous..
0,CUTE TITLE ... NOT AS FUNNY INSIDE,"When I listened to the author being interviewed, I thought the book was hilarious ... The interview was funnier than the actual text! A little disappointing!"
0,tremendously bad,Just terrible and not worth the money. The fights are horrible and the fighters have very little skill. Puchase PRIDE instead where the best fighters in the WORLD come to fight.
0,Not very smart design,"Read the other negative reviews. I had the same problems. Suction would only be effective if you lift the vacuum and place it directly on the mess. Otherwise, the bristles would just spread the garbage before the suction in the center could get to it."
0,"Worst ""Clancy"" book I have read","Although I have read only a few of the ""Clancy"" knock-offs, I have to say this is the worst. I cannot believe Tom Clancy allowed his name to be associated with this book. It was plain boring."
0,Not a good Clancy - Wild Card,"Unfortunately, a badly written story. Not one that I would recommend. I read everything that comes out from Tom Clancy, and I am generally happy - from satisfied to delighted. This time, not, even though the plot was quite interesting."
0,One of the worst books I've read in years.,"This is just another of the low quality books put out under the ""Tom Clancy"" name.The book is written by Jerome Preisler and is by far one of the worst books I've read in some time.The plot is very poorly defined, and is so poorly followed that 1/2 the time you are left trying to figure out how a chapter fit into the rest of the book.Character development was minimal at best, and completely missing at worst.There were two main plot lines that had virtually nothing to do with each other, and trying to follow them simply made the book unreadable.My advice is that you don't waste your time on this sell out of a ""Tom Clancy"" novel."
0,Get something else!,I am disappointed in a wheel endorsed by JR.... You can't set the sensitivity. You you find yourself turning the wheel 90 degrees for a 45 degree turn. For Nascar thunder series it works a bit better than the analog controls for anything else its not worth the 40 bucks to get. Find another race wheel!
0,Disgusting,"This is the cheapest and most poorly designed racing wheel i have ever used. It is very uncomfortable on your lap or on a table. It cannot be calibrated and has no shifter. Do your self a favor and buy the Mad Catz MC2 racing wheel instead of this. It is incredible. I dont beleive it is on this sight, but look for it, its a great deal. Once again, dont waste your thirty dollars on this product."
0,DONT BUY THIS PRODUCT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,I had this steering wheel for 3 months and then it stoped working.The steering wheel stunk while I had it.I couldn't keep lt straight so unless you want a terrible steering wheel don't buy this product.
0,Its just business,"For young kids that can't fully appreciate driving, this is the cheap solution for a great gift. For teenagers and up, it's going to be painful driving using this system...you'll go right back to your standard control. I am returning mine ASAP, it turns left very well but not right...try driving like that!"
0,DON'T BUY IT!,"This is the worst product for the PS2 that I have yet encountered. How could anybody but an interact employee give it four stars when the pedals don't work!?! Well, its true...nothing works, too much play in the steering wheel, lag time, it's just awful and that's all there is to it."
0,A very silly book.,"I found it very difficult to extract the information I needed from this book. There are far too many ""Well let's see."" and ""Simple, right?"", and silly analogies which dilute the material. The author can't make a point without embedding it in a story. I'd rather read the Oracle documentation and avoid the annoying task of weeding through irrelevant text."
0,Short tracks!!??,"What's with the short tracks, seconds??? Something seems to be missing here. Wasted my money."
0,Garbage,"This album is pure garbage, none of the tracks are credited to Bronze Nazareth. These appear to be tracks by Bronze before he got with the Wu. The beats are terrible, the rhymes are lackluster. I'd suggest if you're really in to Bronze get his solo album, the great migration, and his group effort The Wiseman. Those are the official albums you want to get. Don't get souped in to this garbage."
0,Where is Ware?,"I had hoped this book would have more about Chris Ware, but most of it is the author's boring observations about comic art and his theories about what Ware is drawing. I would much rather read about the subject's childhood, and especially the details of his time in art school and in Austin. Instead there's endless verbiage in the Scott McCloud vein. A few interesting reproductions of Ware creations I hadn't seen before are included, but not much else is worth recommending."
0,Not what you may think,"I may be stupid but I thought this was a point and shoot controller when I ordered it. It is really just a mouse that looks like a pistol, pull the the trigger to click the mouse etc. I found no use for this device, maybe some would enjoy the feel of a gun in their hand when playing FPSs, not me."
0,"Great Fiction, Nonfiction at its worst","Judith Reitman uses half-truths and hearsay to help create a panic involving a mythological pet theft ring that simply does not exist. Interview every dog researcher in the US and find that pets are too high strung to be research subjects. Even if pets were available as research subjects, they would not be suitable. Reitman uses ""facts"" from long ago to substantiate a supposed problem today. She warns to beware of the pet theft ring, when in fact you should beware of Judith Reitman."
0,OY!!!,"I received this book from a friend of mine who knew that Jane Eyre was one of my favorite books...and it is only out of love for her that I finished it....The idea of story of Jane Eyre being told through Adèle's perspective, at first, absolutely delighted me. But I had assumed that Emma Tennant would have at least STUCK TO Charlotte Bronte's story!You start to read it and begin to note the creative liberties and changes that the author made; they start small only startling you a little, making you wonder where the author's twists intend to take you. Then it just becomes ridiculously laughable. LAUGH OUT LOUD laughable!It is a very 'creative' story and an easy read (if your stomach can take it). I only recommend this people who read Jane Eyre a loooooong loooong time ago, and only vaguely recollect events and names....it will put the reader in the same frame of mind that the author was in."
0,Why does author bother?,"I picked this book up because I love Jane Eyre and had a renewed interest after seeing the excellent Masterpiece Theatre version last month. Emma Tennant has written a few sequels to Pride and Prejudice which were terrible, but I thought I'd give her yet another chance. This book was so bad, I didn't even finish it. Too many narrators, characters inconsistent with the source material, idiotic storylines, etc., etc.Don't waste your money."
0,Extremely disappointing,"The first half of the novel is well done, and enchanting in places. However, plot twists often become confusing, and by the last chapter, we are led to the most implausible surprise-- that Mrs. Fairfax was somehow the evil queen in all this. Nothing in the entire novel prepared us for this, and thus, it felt completely contrived. Perhaps the author was trying to be gothic, but she failed utterly to convince this reader. I felt cheated of the true richness and emotional depth that is ""Jane Eyre."""
0,huh?,"While I liked following the new perspectives of an old favorite, it seemed like Tennant was trying too hard to write as a classic. I was often confused by what she was writing. The wording/descriptions were awkward, difficult to follow, and not completely confident (or competent)."
0,A total waste of time...,"Not only is this book horribly written, but it is hard to follow. The author skips around, while changing the original premise of the book, so you are often at a loss about what is going on. It's as if she's trying to tell the ""real"" story of what happened in the original book. She throws in various hints at sadism and lesbianism, and I wonder if this was just to create a buzz about a book she herself knew wouldn't make much sense. The characters come off as disgusting, even making Jane a jello-headed twit. Adele is compared to Rochesters insane wife, and you will find it hard to find one sympathetic character. I wasn't expecting much from this book, but it was much much worse than I would have thought. Don't waste your time."
0,"very poor writing, poor storyline",I read this w/ high anticipation but both the outlandish storyline and the unusually poor authorship made it a vast disappointment.
0,Not so good.,"I remember reading a portion of this novel in a class in which I read Jane Eyre. That excerpt sparked my interest but, when I started reading this novel, that interest was quickly sullied by the bad prose, inattention to detail, and the stupidity of the plot (especially toward the end). This book is not worth your time or money. For a much better ""rewrite"" of Jane Eyre, read Jean Rhyss' Wide Sargasso Sea."
0,Did she read Jane Eyre?,"It's an interesting concept, but if you love Jane Eyre, don't read this book. The plot is slightly confusing, but besides that, there are many small details from Jane Eyre that the author has either changed or seemed to miss entirely. I expected a romance, but instead, I found something that trashed the story of Jane and Edward Rochester."
0,I wouldn't bother reading it if I were you!,"I purchased and read this book after reading several other negative reviews because I'm stubborn. I wish I'd saved my money. The story is (I'm not sure I have the words to describe it)vague, disjointed. Even than doesn't seem like an adequate description. It's almost as if the author were hallucinating. . .it just doesn't make much sense a lot of the time. I'm currently reading ""Jane Eyre's Daughter"" and enjoying it much more. If you love ""Jane Eyre"" and want a sequel that you can actually understand, I'd recommend ""Jane Eyre's Daughter"" but ABSOLUTELY NOT ""Thornfield Hall"" unless you're in the mood for a psychadelic acid trip."
0,Disappointing product,"This birdfeeder has enough going against it that I wouldn't purchase it if given another chance. The central wire makes it swing much more in the wind, making it difficult for birds to feed on a windy day. Although the cover has a button to hold the lid in place, on windy days, the button doesn't hold well and the bird food dumps all over the ground. Also, the plastic windows aren't big enough and are barely held in place by the 2 metal clips that line the side of each edge. The plastic fell out when the wind blew my feeder off a really secure branch. However, at least it didn't break. So, overall, I'm not happy with this feeder and wouldn't recommend it to others."
0,Not very happy,"I'm disappointed with this product. I agree with the reviewer who said that the wire with the plastic button doesn't hold the cover firmly in place. This makes the food spill all over the ground. The holes are too big, too. I put tape on the inside over the openings to make them smaller so if the feeder tips less spills out. Also, when you fill it, it's too easy for the plastic sides to get dislodged--then the food really pours out. On top of all this, the birds seem to prefer my $7.99 feeder from the hardware store. I'm not going to toss this, but I wouldn't buy it again. More trouble than it's worth, and wasteful."
0,Skip This One,Birdfeeder has a couple of design flaws that make it unuseable as far as our yard goes. The top does not fit secure on top (slips off with the slightest bump) and the press clip slide on the wire that releases the top to move up and down does not hold securely. Therefore... top is easily set askew when a squirrel jumps causing the feeder to lean to one side and stay there and spilling seed. I don't know how the reviewer can say that the seed doesn't spill. I lose about a cup of seed everytime the squirrel jumps on it. Cute feeder - bad design. Going to my auction box. Waste of money.
0,Definitely NOT Squirrel Proof!,"I only had this up for a couple of days, and the squirrels quickly learned how to ""jump"" on it to make it swing wildly which causes the lid to come off (despite being secured) and seeds dropping to the ground. The squirrels then drop to the deck and eat the seeds, along with birds and chipmunks. Blasted squirrels!"
0,Smaller Than Expected,"Claims to hold 5 pounds, but holds maybe 2 pounds or less of sunflower seeds. I don't see how it could hold 5 pounds of anything. Plus, design allows birds to scatter a significant number of seeds on the ground. I'm also concerned about rain getting in through the large openings. I may try to block them partially. It looks nice, but I wouldn't order another because of the design."
0,Tilts and empties all seed.,A design flaw in this feeder. There is no center bar to keep the wire from sliding into the corner. This effectively dumps the seed.
0,Spills A Lot,"The squirrels have not managed to get into this bird feeder, but they don't need to. It spills so much seed that there is plenty for them on the ground. It spills when I try to fill it. It spills when larger birds try to eat. It spills when little birds eat. It spills in the wind. If the seed lands on my deck, the squirrels get it after all. If it lands in a flower pot, it sprouts and I have millet along with flowers.It looks OK and might work if you have squirrels and have a place to hang the feeder where a lot of seed on the ground is not a problem."
0,squirrel-proof wire hanger?,"What a ludicrous claim. In a way, I suppose it worked. The feeder was so easy for squirrels to get into, six of them died laughing!"
0,Bird Feeder,This is one of the worst bird feeders I've ever bought. It allows the birds to waste seed and the top doesn't stay seated.
0,Poor product,We just received this and the lid comes off super easy and allows all bird feed to fall out. Horrible purchase!
0,southern squirrels and large southern birds figured it out,We ordered 2 but unwrapped and set up one as a trial. In 2 days squirrels and large birds had figured out how to access the seed. We took pictures of our smarter NC squirrels and birds asproof!!
0,um what this is a horror movie,this movie was terrible. i only give it abit of credit because it has two guys full frontal. one beefcake model and a emo/musician. the camera angle and plot where the worst. nothin too good about this movie
0,If you wany a good science fiction book do not read this boo,"I read this book and I found that, though the story idea was okay, the author used too much description and not enough action and wrecked what could have been an excellent book"
0,Useless,"This guide is only useful if you're planning to visit the Iran of 2000 years ago. Practical information is non-existant, hardly any reasonable hotels are mentioned and there are few if any travel details. Unlike most Bradt guides it's written for scholars and archeologists and not travellers who need detailed information about this complex country."
0,Not good for babies,"We took this to the beach and didn't use it once. It got warm inside it and my three month old would not use it. It may be better for him as a toddler or in the house, but not as a baby at the beach. We ended up using a bigger tent that I could sit in and hold him instead."
0,better products available,"This tent does what it claims to do, but it takes a lot of energy to put the poles together & set up the tent. If you use it rarely, or leave it set up, this really isn't a problem. If, however, you need to tend to baby while setting up the tent, good luck. Wait until there is a second person around to help you with the job.I found a slightly larger tent for a cheaper price at Fred Meyer. The one I found (I'm returning this one) simply pops open with one hand & folds/twists shut (like those round windshield shades)."
0,You get what you pay for,"For our first child we had the quick cabana we loved it!! It however only survived two years with an active toddler, two dogs and a cat. This time we opted for a cheaper version intended for the beach. It is awkward to put up especially on a windy beach. You have to watch the direction of the sun because sun gets through all sides. The vecro closure is a pain. To weigh the tent down we had to put our beach bag in it not leaving much room for our nine month old. If you are looking for a tent for little ones to play inside and intend to keep it up this is the tent for you. If you want a tent for the beach or just to be outside. Go for the quick cabana. We loved that tent and wish we would have spent the extra money. This tent for us has become a playroom tent. You get what you pay for. Wish we would have gone with the quick cabana"
0,Broke on 3rd usage,"This tent was actually great for the time that it lasted. Problem is that that was only 2 days. One piece of the flexing plastic poles that form its frame broke, rendering the whole tent unusable. Would recommend paying more for something more robust."
0,Not for my child,"My son was 10 months old when I purchased this for outdoors. He kept trying to get out of it by trying to get through the sides, so it would end up tipping over with him in it. Maybe this is good if you have a passive baby, but not so active.I didn't give it 2 stars for durability or educational either. I give it 1 all around."
0,Portable Play Tent,"It was pretty easy to assemble, but we tried to use it for the beach with our 4 month old and it wasn't a success. It kept blowing away, wasn't 100% sun protection and it was hot inside. When it blew away we got sand all over the little guy - which was a BUMMER! It would be nice if it had little pockets on the side so you could shovel sand into it. For an infant and beach use, not the best purchse for us. Probably good for parks and when it is a bit cooler."
0,Get another one!!!,The poles bent when I was putting it together. I have since seen tents that are easier to put together with one pull of a string. This is easy to store in the bag they give you. But I wouldn't recommend this product.
0,Tough to put together,"Once put together, this tent is exactly what we wanted. The issue is actually getting it assembled. It took two people to get the poles into their holders. We were hoping to bring this to the beach with us but I can't imagine trying to get it set up while our little one is sitting in the sun. I think it's worth it to pay slightly more money and get a pop-up tent."
0,Tested positive for lead,"We were very pleased with the item until my husband saw my daughter chewing on one of the frame pieces and decided to use an at-home lead test to test it. Sure enough, it tested positive for lead! Not acceptable."
0,TIPS OVER - USELESS AT THE BEACH,"I hate to write a negative review...I had such high hopes for this little tent. But the truth is, there is no way to secure it in the sand or prevent your little guy or girl from tipping it over again and again.The tent itself seems very strong and well-made. However, the poles don't dig down into the sand, and there are no pouches on it to fill with sand to weight it down. From what I hear, the Infant Cabana from One Step Ahead (although more costly) is a much better way to go. I guess you get what you pay for.My son was able to play with his toys in this tent, but once he saw people outside, he was pushing on the mesh screens to try and get to us, and the tent just kept tipping over. Very frustrating and NOT relaxing at all. We spent a week at the beach and used it only once before we realized it was pretty much useless.If I had it to do over again...I'd try One Step Ahead. I've never been disappointed by them. Should've known better."
0,tips over way too easy,"The Description Says It is for kids up to two years old, but my child easily tips this over at sixteen months by pushing on the walls, not safe at all. If the tent had not been sitting partially under my kitchen table, my kid would have slapped his face right into the tile floor. Reading one of the other posts about this product containing lead, it's going back for sure."
0,Not what I expected,"I bought this tent for my 4 1/2 month old because it stated on the description that it offered UV protection. We were going on a family vacation and I needed something to protect the baby while on the beach. This product is a waste of money if you need it for the outdoors:1. It does not say UV protected anywhere on the packing - this is a lie. I contacted the company twice about this and they cannot provide me with an answer. They will not confirm or deny it, which is false advertising.2. There is no way to anchor the tent. The tent was blowing all over the place. I had to put bags inside to weigh it down. I didn't even put my baby in there for fear she would blow away. I brought it to the beach the first day and didn't even bother bringing it back.If you want the tent for play indoors it should be fine but do not expect to use it outdoors especially if it is windy or sunny."
0,it was just okay,"we bought this nursery tent to take to the beach with us to protect our 9 month old son from the sun. we liked the mesh netting which allowed air to flow through the tent. however, one day was pretty windy and the anchors provided are not sturdy enough to secure it. the wind toppled it over with our son lying inside. it didn't blow away or very far since we were sitting right next to it, but it still toppled over. i wouldn't recommend it for a trip to the beach!"
0,not sturdy,"I got this for my 15 mt old daughter for Christmas. I am most disappointed with the lack of sturdiness of the plastic base pieces. Also, there are levers that you can flip down under the piano part that is supposed to keep the piano steady instead of letting it rock. My piano levers did not work and the piano always rocks. The long piece that runs from the piano base out to hold the seat part is very flimsy and bends quite easily. The seat itself does not fit properly onto the long plastic piece that is supposed to hold it. The screws to attach the long piece to the piano and the screws to attach the seat were very difficult to work with and they never did go in right. My daughter does love to play the keys on the piano and the music is quite nice but the design of the seating section needs some improvement."
0,Crap,"overall this movie is horrible. for someone who practices martical arts myself, some of these scenes are almost insulting. espescially the kano vs. sonya scence. she obviously has no knowledge of any form of martial arts and watching her fight almost made me feel embarassed for her. the only thing this movie is good for is entertaining you when your completely gone from too much alcohol consumption."
0,Shallow and predictable,"When you take a video game where the whole game is simply one-on-one fighting, there is not much story to go with. Apparently the makers of this movie simply accepted that fact and said ""so what?""The action scenes are at times enjoyable, at times laughable, and at times boring. But more importantly, there are other ways they could have worked the use of fight scenes into this movie. That's one of the (few) things that they did better in the second film. Simply saying ""we're here for a Mortal Kombat tournament"" is easy but uninteresting.That said, it is interesting the ways they worked in some of the elements of the games. Those would only really matter to fans of the plotless video game series."
0,Ok but come on!,alright it had cool special effects but the video game is known for its violence - if you play the games right before you watch the movie you'd swear it was Barneys great adventure!
0,A popular video game is as real as it gets,"The film dose not have graphic violence in it like the video game does, because this is a kids movie."
0,Why is this a DVD?,"Once again, the poor review does not reflect my feelings for the movie. ""Mortal Kombat"" is simply the best...scratch that...the ONLY good movie based on a video game. There's enough in it for fans and newcomers alike to enjoy. It's a big, silly ninja movie that doesn't take itself seriously, which is great.However, what's with the ... DVD? Trailors is what they offer us, nothing more? No commentaries, deleted scenes, or even ""making of""s?Well, forget it. Sod off, Mr. DVD Man. Buy the VHS copy, everyone, you'll get everything out of it you need. Refuse to support lazy DVDs!"
0,A horrible film by a horrible director (Paul W.S. Anderson),"What is there to say about this film you ask? Nothing much sadly because the storyline is too simplistic and offers too many cliches. The character development isn't that great, and most of the action sequences aren't very well choreographed. The only real great fight scenes were with Lou Kang vs. Reptile and the fight with Johnny Cage vs. Scorpion, so it's kind of a let down considering this film is based on a fighting game. The special effects in this movie aren't that impressive because you can tell it's not real. The only great acting performance in this film was by Christopher Lambert as Raiden, but everyone else wasn't really convincing in their roles. Overall, if you're a die hard fan of the video game series then you might enjoy this, but I think you want see a better sci-fi action film, then see the Terminator series or the original Star Wars trilogy."
0,Dull Wombat,"I was dragged against my will to the local suburban theater to watch this tepidly dull and overtly violent film. Suffice it to say I left the theater about half way through this tedious exercise in patience. This is plainly J-U-N-K. It concerns the wildly popular video game and brings the characters to 'life' or should I say, 'to death'? The fighting scenes are horrible, and there are too many of them and they are so violent that one becomes sickened by it all. There is also excessively loud techno music to add to the disaster. I would prefer watching the old Shaw brothers Kung-Fu movies better than this banal viewing."
0,What do you expect from something based on a video game?,"Paper-thin plot, laughable acting, and bad fight scenes in which one can easily guess the winner. The only saving grace is the special effects and art direction, but that can't keep Mortal Kombat from being a crashing bore. Designed for 11-to-12 year old boys."
0,100% pizzazz made to cash in for a week and be forgotten,"Okay, first thing's first: I don't think there's anything wrong with attempting to make a movie based on a video game. It's just that this one is so weak and uninspired, It'll leave even Mortal Kombat fans disappointed (unless they're easily pleased and have short attention spans). The plot is very weak and contrived, the characters are 1-dimmensional and made of plastic, and the fight scenes are often ludicrous (escpecailly the ""double kicking"" move Lui Kang does to Reptile, which is quite laughable). The fight scenes had to be toned down for the movies rating (it still bothers me when they'll try and make a PG-13 movie from an R rated game).The visiual effects (particularly the netherworld) are interesting but only mediocre at best. In short, this movie is just a sell-out, and quite forgettable. Someone down below stated that this was ""The Best Movie of all Time."" I feel sorry for that person. I wonder if he has ever seen a good movie."
0,Wrong DVD. Huge FAIL,"I got the ""Mortal Kombat"" case but the ""Last Tango in Paris"" DVD. I didn't bother to return because I don't have time to ship it back but I am very displeased."
0,A poorley made film that will give you a headache...,"An adaptation of a popular game, but this is a poor film in which every fight scene has some irritating techno music. The f/x are not too bad, but this film is way too corny for me..."
1,"Suprisingly Entertaining Sequel to ""Death Note""","I was'nt really expecting much from this sequel to the Death Note saga, but I was pleasently surprised by it. The story centers around the strange, always hungry detective from the first two films, ""L"". This time, he gets involved with a plot by some crazies to release a bio-weapon that will kill millions. But the clock is ticking in more ways than one: L only has a few weeks to live due to his writing his own name in the Death Note book. In my opinion, this film is just as good as the first two and is a great end to the whole story arc. Fans of Asain cinema will love this one as well as those who rarely watch these types of movies."
1,Great seller,This was for my daughter's bday and it was in great condition and the shipping was fast. No complaints. She loves this series in the movies and this was just another movie to add to her collection.
1,3 ia crowd?,maybe not my favorite film is the series.bought it more or less or the completion aspect of having the whole set.but still very interesting to see what the filmmakers did to fill in the gap between the 23 days and L's death at the end of the 2nd film.
1,GReat,this proudot i got was very new and in good conidetion it had everything with it still wrapped in the plastice no sccathes and a very good movie i was very happy with my purchse
1,Testament: The Bible in History,"Romer sees the entirte picture and situates the growth of Scripture in its historical and cultural context. He makes one think at the same time as entertaining-no mean feat. His scholarship is thorough, accessable and well thought out. The locations make the entire series even more worthwhile. One of the best in its field"
1,"Highly recommended, especially for public library DVD collections","As originally shown on the Discovery channel, Testament is a seven-part series on DVD revealing what archaeology and the evidence of history can tell us about the Bible, especially the stories of Abraham, the Exodus, and Jesus of Nazareth. Host and expert archaeologist John Romer shows the viewer dig sites at Jericho, Jerusalem, and elsewhere in his quest to unravel the hidden mysteries of scripture. An extraordinary presentation intended for believers and non-believers alike, Testament is highly recommended, especially for public library DVD collections. 3 DVDs, 363 minutes, full screen, SDH subtitles."
1,Found at Last! Testament is the discovery of the ages!,"John Romer guides you back through time, sifting through artifacts, sand and myth. This is one of the most important series in the 25 years! I remember the first time I viewed it, I was blown away by his knowledge, technique and enthusiasm. He is a wonderful and persuasive story teller. I am so happy to find this set on DVD. I have worn out two sets of videos I had recorded on VHS. I cannot wait to watch this series and spend time with my old friend. You do not have to be Christian, or religious in any sense of the word to experience the wonder of it all."
1,13 Cent Killers,"This was a good view of a little known group of heros. I am very pleased that someone took the time to record, for history, some of the things these brave men did. Viet Nam was a questionable war we were involved, but these young men met the call of their country and served bravely doing what ever was asked of them. Weather you beleived in the war or not, It does take away from men answering the call. Simper Fi 5th Marines"
1,"Solid, but not as nice as could be","I just ordered and received this. I haven't used it yet, so this is an initial impression. It's fairly nice, and feels solid. The only thing I don't like is that the thumb screw used to adjust the unit is made of plastic, and looks cheap. It may hold up well over time, but it makes the unit feel cheap, which it isn't."
1,Good Value Marking Guage,"This classic marking gauge meets my expectations for a quality tool, A must for any progect with mortise and tenon or dovetail joints. Would recommend this guage if you are looking for a value priced tool."
1,Will show you how to enjoy the outdoors well below zero!,"This is really a great guide that just about covers every relevant detail on winter camping. Its been my springboard to extensive winter outdoor activity. In here you'll find all the basics: Gorman discusses everything from gear for travel like skis, to camping technique, to clothing, safety, etc. He presents modern techniques & tips but he also mentions traditional info. as applicable.Specific to this edition of the book are a handful of new pictures but most of the material is almost the same as the earlier edition, which is to say great. Thus if you can't get a hold of this edition not to worry as the previous edition is as good."
1,The Title Says It All,I've always loved Levert music and I think this cd has all my favorite songs on it. It's a wonderful cd. It's the type of cd that you can play on repeat. I recommend this cd to all married couples. And I also suggest I've Been Waiting as a honeymoon songs.
1,One of my favorite albums,"Not many people have rated this album very high, but I think it is great. Clever lyrics and catchy tunes."
1,How dare you not buy this CD?,"If you're browsing the 10cc section, the chances are that you already have a reasonable idea of what you're looking for. Well, you've found it. 'How dare you?' stands up against the very best that 10cc has to offer. With only the occasional lapse in concentration, the band present us with another classic body of work. With enough hooks to snare the harshest critic, it's all aboard for a ride through pop standards, lavish production numbers, tight harmonies, and technically adept guitaring. 'Art for art's sake', 'Lazy ways', 'Rock and roll lullaby', and 'Don't hang up' stand up to the test of time particularly well, but if that's not enough for you then 'I'm Mandy fly me' should do the trick."
1,Qigong for Beginners,"I am a person that does not like exercise. Since Qigong is good for the immune system, and I heard it was good for asthma, I decided to give it a try. The deep breathing along with gentle stretching was not at all strenuous. I must say my breathing appeared to be better after the exercises. Along with these exercises were different head, face, and leg massages that would trigger accu-pressure points. I found the DVD very relaxing and informative."
1,My Personal View,"This product is very informative and if you apply the instructions that are given, you can't miss. You can do these exercises at home on your own time and feel the results in a short time. This puts your health back in your own hands and you are in control. The bottom line is that it works and I hope more people buy this book and use it to their own advantage. I can't say enough about it. Ron"
1,WOW !!!,WOW absolutly fantastic. slow and easy to follow excellent coverage of positions and their applacations.
1,Great for carpal tunnel and bad back.,This DVD is great. It's really helping with my carpal tunnel. It's really soothing and fun to do. It's also helping with my bad lower back. I'd highly recommend it.
1,Qigong Beginners,"This is an excellent start. I sometimes have a hard time moving in certain directions with my arthritis and Fibromyalgia. But with these instructions going nice and slow, I can do them as long as no one insists I do it perfectly. I like the background and the music and with the two of them (husband and wife)doing it together, I can get a good idea of what I need to do. I am quite pleased with it, altogether."
1,"Nice,","It would be nice to have a personal instructor in one's meditation space; but since that is not going to happen this dvd is quite nice.This is not the first qi gong dvd that I've tried to follow. I've also had classes. This dvd is much better than anything that I have experienced before.The moves are reasonably well explained. The purpose for the moves is also explained, which makes them meaningful.If nothing else one feels relaxed. I felt improvement in my health condition immediately"
1,Great,"Very easy to follow and learn, plus the documentary disc is so informative and his journey to learn was awesome."
1,Easy to Follow,This is a solid method for getting your energy up and getting flexible through daily practice. Very enjoyable. Would recommend to those looking in to adding Qigong to there daily routine.
1,Classic Bitchin' Babes,"OK, I'll admit it. I bought this CD, a few years back, for the cover title, the cover art, and the song titles (including ""Prisoners of Their Hairdos,"" ""Not Bad for a Broad,"" and ""Sensitive New Age Guys."") I thought it would either be terribly funny or the gals could really sing. A ""10"" on both counts. Loved this CD so much I bought all the other ""Bitchin Babes"" CDs. Guess that makes me a virtual Babehead."
1,SGT PEPPER'S NOT THE FIRST THOUGH,"With 888 reviews before me --I will not bore you to tell you how great the album is --just some points the other reviewers (no... I did not read them all) seem to miss. If there is one who reiterated any of my points... I apologize ..1) This is not the first concept Album but then again neither was Pet Sounds...that honor goes to Ol Blue Eyes himself --Frank Sinatra in 1955 with the classic In The Wee Small Hours(on Capitol by the way) was recorded in 1955 a full 12 years before Pepper, the first 12 inch concept album.2) If one is lucky to get the rare mono album of Pepper -u are in for a real treat ---the mix is different and I swear there are different takes than the normal Stereo mix of the album.3) The Pepper Album is not overated at all it deserves every alcolade it gets-It truly is THE CLASSIC ROCK ALBUM OF ALL TIME."
1,As good as it gets,"How good is this album let me count the ways. Words like masterpiece classic genius are usually used when descibing this album I would throw in timeless,sublime,mystical & surreal. When it comes to the greatest music of all time you have beethoven bach radiohead and the beatles at the top. You can safely place this album alongside ok computer as the greatest musical achievment of our time. A beautiful piece of music that will echo down through the ages.Peace."
1,The defining musical statement of the 20th century,"Hundreds of years from now, this album will stand as the defining musical statement of the 20th century. If you are old enough to remember when it first came out, buy it, hook up the headphones and step into the time machine. If you are too young to have been steeped in every track of this magnificent work of art, buy it, hook up the headphones and suddenly see the foundation on which most popular music was built. It is as fresh and meaningful today as it was nearly 40 years ago. No one who cares about modern music can be without this album. It's that simple."
1,4000 Holes in Blackburn Lancashire... None In Sgt. Pepper!,"On first hearing this album, I certainly did not have second thoughts about the writing, construction, harmony, etc. of the songs. This album is not only my favourite Beatles album of all time, it is my favourite album of all time (of course, compared to anything else)...A true classic!"
1,Lets get a grip people.,"Can anybody say songwriting? Melody?Stan : Who says change is good? Things got heavier, but the songwriting for a large part got worse. I wish music would take a 180 myself.Also, it is true Dylan is not a ""good singer"". But I would rather listen to him than a lot of people. He is expressive in his singing, and brings out emotion better than most anybody else I have heard.Those are just my opinions though. (I do like Cream, LZ, BS, and Hendrix but... I would not say they were a step ahead of the Beatles or Dylan.)"
1,DeLuxe,"Nothing much to add about the album, all is being said already. I ordered this one, got it and asked myself: what is the meaning of ""[DELUXE EDITION]""? It was just a plain and simple cd: jewelcase, cd with standard tracks, booklet, nothing more."
1,A MASTERPIECE,"THIS IS THE GREATEST ALBUM EVER RECORDED,PEROID.NO CAN ESCAPE ITS INFLUENCE.HARRISONS WITHIN YOU WITHOUT YOU IS A CHILLING LOOK AT ONE MANS SEARCH FOR PIECE OF MIND.RINGOS LEAD VOCALS ON ALITTLE HELP FROM MY FRIENDS ARE SOLID,WHILE HIS DRUMMING IS GROUNDBREAKING.LENNON AND MCCARTNEY WROTE SEVERAL SPECTACULAR SONGS HERE,WHILE THE TWO ALONG WITH HARRISON ARE STELLAR ONALL LEAD AND HARMONY VOCALS.THEY GUITAR WORK IS SUPERB,WHILE MCCARTNEYS BASS LINES ARE THE MOST MELODIC IN ROCK HISTORY. THE ALBUM HAS SOME OBSCURE,STELLER SONGS LIKE MCCARTNEYS FIXING A HOLE.EVEN THE LP COVER IS SUPER."
1,Blown Away!,"Obviously the best Beatles album, which tells you the quality in itself. Even if you're not a Beatles fan like me, you'll love it. I can't put the music itself into words. Just listen to it!"
1,A Day In The Life,"Before this album was released, nobody took rock music very seriously. Before this album was released, rock music was just something that you could dance to (although it still made a point but nevertheless, just dance music). When this was released however, the face of rock & roll would change. Yes my friends, this album can never be overstated. Sgt. Pepper's is definitely one the best albums the Beatles ever made (just the White Album or Abbey Road can be defined at their magnum opus). If your a classic rock fan, add this on top of your shopping list."
1,mono mix is very different,"Up until ABBEY ROAD, there were seperate mixes for all BEATLE tracks -- one in mono, and another in stereo. The Beatles normally would sit in on the mono mixes, and leave the stereo versions to George Martin and crew. There are many marked differences between the two versions of this classic album, most notibly during the finale of GOOD MORNING, GOOD MORNING, SGT. PEPPER REPRISE and A DAY IN THE LIFE. If you are a student of the stereo version, you will easily pick out all of the changes. A very interesting listen, and quite a rare piece of vinyl to boot."
1,It blew away everything that came before.,"The most important album in history, and while it might not be The Beatles best (Abbey Road or Revolver), that says more about the greatness of the group than the weaknesses (if any) of the album."
1,Lovely Rita meets Lucy in the Sky Within You Without You,"Of all the CDs I have bought in the past, I've regretted buying about 20 of them. This wasn't one of them. I was a Beatle freak for two whole years before I got around to trading in a few worthless CDs for this one. I'm glad I did. Sgt. Pepper is the best Beatles album ever (no offense to Abbey Road or the White Album or to Rubber Soul). It is a must for anyone into psychedelia and the first I'd recommend to any Beatles neophyte. The songs have a color and texture all their own, with tape loops and sitars and voice modulation and...oooh! It's all too wonderful to describe. If you've never heard this album, go out and buy it, or, if you're a penny pincher, find a friend who has it and borrow it (but don't ask me for mine--I don't lend it out). Listen to it with an open mind. You won't be the same. I certainly never was.-------L. Vaughn God Help and Breed You All --J. Lennon"
1,Excellent cindition fast ship,I received the Sgt PEPPERS LONELY HEARTS CLUB BAND by the Beatles fast and in LIKE NEW condition. That includes the cover and the CD.
1,Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band,All in perfect conditions. Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band is one of the best lp of the history...Thanks for all and best regards
1,Why is everyone trashin' the Beatles?,"Any bored Beatles fan would enjoy reading some of the 1-star, 2-star, or even 3-star reviews for ""Sgt. Pepper."" They angry the blood! I'll admit that this album was not their best, but it is arguably one of the best. The album's placement in music history is also undisputed. But why do these ""Beatle fans"" suddenly become harsh critics of a famous, classic rock album (I didn't say the best, or the greatest, just a famous one). If you want to write about a ""terrible"" Beatles album, pick 1964's ""Beatles for Sale"" or even worse is the Yellow Submarine soundtrack (not the one recently released, but the one with classical music on side two, from 1969). Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band is a milestone in rock and one of the best works in the Beatles' catalog."
1,not good enough,"When I listen to this album it sounds like the Beatles were jaded from too much songwriting that they felt like being sarcastic and pretending to be fictitious characters and that left George Martin with the creative responsibilities of making average material sound interesting with his studio tricks and distinctive psychedelic/classical production and that's what people see as being revolutionary about this album.Sgt. Pepper's isn't even in my top 5 Beatles LP's because it really sounds like they were just messing around, but it still sounds classic."
1,Stunning,"For those who here have ""reviewed"" this masterpiece of modern music, and found it too trippy, retro, or whatever, you are sorely mistaken. In fact, it is in my view impossible for someone not around in the late '60s to have any appreciation at all for what this album did to popular music---it turned it on its head and changed everything. This album simply cannot be judged from today's perspective--so much of what has transpired since the release of this record was born of it. SPLHCB is the single most influential piece of modern music period--with all due respect to Mr. Dylan."
1,"Man, does it grow on you","When I first listened to this album, I sincerely thought that I hated it. It was just so *weird*! But I realized soon afterwards that this wasn't the reason that I was constantly playing it. Now, Sgt. Pepper is always listed as one of my favorite albums, in comparison with the Beatles or the rest of rock and roll."
1,The first and best and concept album of all time,This is the most influential album by the most influential band of the century. It is a must have.
1,The Album That Changed The Music World Forever!!!!,"Totally Breathless. The Beatles hit the big time as ever. What a turn of events on this record. The music,their look,completely different and a classic beyond. This album is virtually timeless. 100 years from now and it still will sound new.Psychedelic has arrived but i personal prefer Revolver over this one but it still spells classic! The most completely different sound that The Fab Four ever released My favorites include.""BEING FOR THE BENEFIT OF MR.KITE,""Lucy IN THE SKY WITH DIAMONDS"",and many more. Classic album cover ."
1,What were you thinking?,"This is one the albums of all time. Not a single ""sampled"" track. Real musicians. Think about the car your parents drove at the time. Can you still get parts for it? I didn't think so. This one stands the test of time. Next."
1,"Clarity & Sound A+, Song labeling F",The album is fantastic for sound quality and clarity. However I was very disappointed to see not one of the song titles displayed on my JBL stereo in my `07 Camry Hybrid after the sticker on the outside of the album bragged about how they had taken extra steps for Ipod song labeling. Granted it is not an Ipod player however other albums show the song names just fine.
1,The only album you'll need on a desert island,"It's got everything: hard rock, soft rock, deep philosophical stuff, levity, warmth, irony, poetry. The list goes on and on. It's like a musical multi-vitamin. Listening to it will ward off the blahs and will definitely make you a more interesting person. I'd like to meet all the neat people who raved about Sgt. Pepper here. You can tell they're uncommonly intelligent, cultured and fun to be around."
1,"Dear Music Fan From Under My Bed,",You are a dumb uncultured cynic for giving this one star. It is obvious to everyone (except you) that this is creative and original music. Go and listen to your Madonna and Culture Club CD's!
1,It's like you've never Sgt. Pepper's before,"WOW!!! I just recieved my first order of the remastered cds today. As I said, it's like hearing these albums for the very first time. And what a sound it is !!! The voices pop out at you, and the instrumentation is clear, crisp and complex in its' simplicity. It becomes evident just how much of a range John and Paul's voice have. For the first time I heard Paul's technique and mastery of the bass; I finally hear how integral and necessary Ringo's drums are. I can't wait to hear the other cd's I recieved and order the remaining ones I need to replace my older editions."
1,MASTERPIECE!,"We will still be talking about this album and listening to it in awe a 1,000 years from now. This is the APEX of popular music. Its finest hour. Forget what they say about Revolver, Abbey Road and all the other outstanding Beatles albums. This is their MASTERPIECE, and is as good as popular music will ever get. And, ""A Day In The Life"" IS THE MOST AMAZING POP SONG EVER RECORDED."
1,The Pepper album...........,"It is always interesting and amusing to read all of reviews written by mainly Kids that were never even around, when this recording was made. Lennon himself made no bones about this, at the time. He scoffed at the notion that this was a "" Concept Album"". He always said that it was a collection of Songs, and that it "" didn't go anywhere, other than the Opening, and the Reprise, at the end"". While I have always enjoyed it, It was Paul's concept, they got to play dress-up, and to do something that was at the time, different, from all of the other Pop songs out."
1,Sgt. Pepper,"This CD is a MUST have for any Beatles fan! It is clean, crisp, and far more spupperior than most remixes of this Album I have heard. Also, there was a copy of the Beatles ""LOVE""CD with this CD. Not sure if it originally shipped that way, but it was a very pleasent surprise. Having never listened to ""LOVE"" I found it to be an ecclectic mix of some of the finest Beatles' songs ever written. Some wierdness on it, but George Martin and his sone were definetly experimenting, as if the days when they originally were mixing Pepper were back. I will be enjoying this for a long time!"
1,BETTER MEMORIES,"In order to take a trip down memory lane, when the Beatles were at their (drug-induced) prime, I bought Sgt Peppers. My college era. In retrospect, Abbey Road would have been a better choice ... better lyrics, more depth, greater maturity (stronger drugs!?). This album did not live up to my expectations or memories."
1,My Purchase Experience,"I went on line and purchased this item and was expecting to receive confirmation from the seller that my order had been received (which is common practice). However, I had to send two emails before I heard from the seller. She finally confirmed about a week later that the order had shipped; I got it the next day. The product was great! I just wish I would have heard from the seller a little sooner. In this day and age with scams and all, it made me a little nervous when I had to send two emails to confirm my purchase. Other than that - awesome!"
1,Pushed the Boundary and Succeeded,"This is the Beatles' signature album. If not considered their best, it is considered one of the most important in pop music history. Originally produced as a response to the brilliant ""Pet Sounds"" (can you top this?) the Beatles extended the limits of music. To argue whether ""Pet Sounds"" or ""Pepper"" is better is irrelevant as both are great. Unlike the CD packaging of the other Beatles CDs, this one is good. It contains background info, alternate photos, etc. The music does not seem to have aged as well as some of the other Beatles' CDs. Perhaps this is due to this album's over-familiarity. However, this does not diminish the fine quality of the songs and does not take away from the historical significance of this album."
1,A good album,"Please people, stop making fun of the people who write: Also recommended : Pentatonic scales for jazz keyboardists or whatever, because whoever writes those reviews usually gives a great, educated, unbiased review and I like being able to find a review that I am probably going to agree with. Oh yeah, good album. One star is ridiculous."
1,Poor Beatle bashers!,"Sure, Sgt. Pepper isn't a full out guitar shronk like ""Are You Experience"" or ""Disreali Gears"". Nobody ever intended it to be. What it is, however, is a marvel of artistic and technological achievement; a better album than anyone is likely to ever make on 4 track tape machines and analogue editing. With this album, the group took POP music (a much larger genre than good ol' ROCK) by the collar and yanked it abruptly into an entirely new environment, one that high brow musicologists and low brow stoners all had to acknowledge. It changed the way everyone has listened to or made pop/rock albums since. Sure, 30 years on in an era of extreme cynicism, alot of folks hear this and wonder what all the fuss was about. But rest assured, scenesters, A HUNDRED YEARS FROM NOW people will still be listening to and talking about this album. And we haven't even started talking about ""The Velvet Underground and Nico"" yet...."
1,"great songs, decent album","it's heresy to admit it, but some of the songs are mediocre, especially playing alongside cuts that are arguably at the apex of 20th century music. day in the life? incredible. lovely rita? please don't make me ever hear it again. within you without you? beyond incredible. mr. kite? oh, dear. she's leaving home? stunningly beautiful. with a little help from my friends? sorry, not a classic. it's about 75% as great as everyone says, and 25% not just 'not great', but not even typically beatles good."
1,"Not even a Beatles fan, but I dig THIS one",words cannot explain the profound effect this legendary album had on the music industry and still does now.The production on this album still sounds crisp 33 years later. Lucy In The Sky With Diamonds is a beautiful track.
1,Greatest Beatles Album Ever...,"First of all, the Rolling Stones are not better than the Beatles. But the Beatles are not better than the Stones either. So don't think you are right when you tell people who the best band in the world is... If you want to argue, go ahead. But they each had their own style and it would be pointless to try and compare these two groups. I hope this clears up the matter. Oh yeah, this is the greatest Beatles album ever..."
1,... And why is the average 4 and A HALF stars?,Dont even get me started on the best Beatles album ever. this should be 5 stars and with a little help from my friends I will be willing to boost it up. This is music.
1,SPECTACULAR!!!,"Okay, forget about all the other reviews about this album because- well, this is the greatest album of all time. I know this album word for word and I think after you hear it as much as I have you will like it better. It is amazing, I mean could the Beatles get any better?!! You melt into the music and drift away into the minds of Paul, John, George and Ringo. Get it!!! Not only the best album of all time but the best BEATLES album of all time (bye bye Revolver!!)!!!!"
1,Nice CD... 4/12 out of 5,"This is a album recored by the greatest rock band in the in the universe... The Beatles!!! This is a true classic and is a great contribution to rock music. Best tracks: Sgt.Pepper, Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds, Fixing a hole,and Good Morning,Good Morning. Also check out my Rubber Soul and Revolver reviews. Rock on!!!"
1,Hmmm...,"Out of all of The Beatles albums, Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band is my absolute favorite! Each song offers something different. I can't really say if I have an individual favorite song off of this album because I love the entire cd! It's all great and I highly recommend that you buy it if you don't have it yet."
1,Great Beatles Album,This is the best Beatle album ever. That's about all I can say. Buy it and judge it for yourselves.
1,Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band,"Just as I remembered it, "" ...sitting on the Sofa with a sister or two... "" The unique aspect of this album is that it buries itself in the mind; tunes, lyric, production technique, not as part of an experience but as one."
1,The First Generation to Grow Up on Sgt. Pepper,"Kevin Arnold (played by Fred Savage, narrated by the actor Daniel Stern) described his own generation (people born in the mid-to-late 1950s and early '60s), in his last ""The Wonder Years"" episode (1993): ""...The first generation to grow up on Sgt. Pepper was heading out into the world..."" (speaking of the summer of 1973). Well, I have always wanted a copy of that album -- so that I could listen to it straight through, and get a better idea what the Kevin Arnold character was talking about. And I am a member of that generation (born 1961)! My favorite tracks were:#1 Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band#2 With a Little Help from my Friends#3 Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds...#12 Sgt. Pepper's... (reprise)#13 A Day in the LifeLoosely translated, I loved it all -- from beginning to end! For best results, play the entire CD straight through. ""We hope you will enjoy the show!"" o:-)"
1,Best Ever,"This has got to be , IMHO, the best album ever recorded by anyone at anytime anywhere. No other single album has touched the musical landscape for the better as this one. This album was world changing. All others bow to the REAL music masters, The Beatles!"
1,One of the best.,Slowly but surely another added to my collection. I've always enjoyed the music from this album and to now have it on CD is great.
1,Back in 1967....,"It was the summer of 1967. I was 14 and 1/2 years old, the biggest Beatle Fan of all my friends and the much anticipated ""Sgt. Pepper"" album was almost ready for release! Finally, the day had come, as I raced down to the local music store! I bought it and brought it home. I stared at the strange but cool artwork as I unwrapped the package. I put it on our Sears StereoPhonic Turnable (how modern!) amd adjusted the bass and tremble controls.Of course, I had every album to date, and was nervous about this new one. Would it be better than the last one?? Would I like it?I played all the songs....and then.... ""A Day In The Life"" came on. I was mesmorized! It was the BEST song I had ever heard! I played it over....and over...and over! I could not get enough of this song! Especially the end, where the last chord takes 36 seconds to fade away! Unbelevable!! And it still is....45 and 1/2 years later!!"
1,Comic Relief.............,"No,not the album,the album is a 5 star classic,the comedy is when some rocket scientist out there gives this 1 or 2 stars...simply hilarious!!!"
1,Somebody needs to know the time glad that l'm here!!!!,"Wow over a thousand reviews ,what else could be said.l am in a hurry so l will just put in Quick plug for an under appreciated John Lennon song ""Good Morning Good Morning""He sang with such confidence about feeing insecure esp the line ""somebody needs to know the time glad that l'm here ""l totally can relate to that, he is so used to being insecure that it feels normal and he can even joke about itThe funky sax section towards the end is great too."
1,Come on...,"Most likely someone is reading this just to see how much others love the album they love. You know how these album changed The Beatles, rock music, music in general, the hippie culture, America, the U.K., and eventually the world. You know all the songs on here. You know they're are at least 13 reason to get this (Sgt.Peppers,A Little Help,Lucy in the Sky, Getting Better, Fixing A Hole, She's Leaving Home,Being for the Benefit, Within You, 64, Rita, Good Morning, The Reprise, and A Day In The Life.) This has been out for almost 30 years. And if you haven't listened to this, for the sake of humanity, experience the world's most important 40 minutes."
1,what can I say?,"There's not much to say really, except: this is music history and anyone who claims to know anything about popular music needs to own this album."
1,"buying this CD is good for ""fixing a hole""in your collection!",this is the very first beatles album i bought. i like most every song on it and i didnt live through the 60s. a must have for rock'n'rollers everywhere!
1,sgt peppers lonely hearts club band,sgt peppers lonely hearts club band album is fantastic as I have always wanted to own it and I love all the songs that are on the album especially hey jude and when I am 64 and octopuses garden and many more of the songs that are well known that are there.I love the beatles and have grown up with them all my life and I recommend this album to anyone who is a beatles fan is a must have album.Michael Pritchard
1,Classic!,"Nobody could or would ever come close to the Beatles... except the Beatles' alter ego band. This is a must have for any Beatles or 60's collection, or even just a first Beatles cd."
1,Masterpiece,"In the fall/winter of 1966/1967, when alot of the press were claiming that the Beatles were ""dead"", the Beatles responded by releasing their artistic masterpiece that knocked everyone's socks off. This album just flows so well, and it's a joy to listen to simply brilliant songwriting - something you don't get much of these days. Everyone knows of the revolutionary production techniques. Unfortunately, this was probably the last time the Beatles truly worked together as a team (arguably ""Abbey Road""). I will probably never tire of listening to this gem."
1,"Astonishingly Good, Ground-Breaking, a Legendary Album","A showcase for the broad spectrum of the Beatles' musical versatility and imagination. This is pioneering rock music and one of the most important and influential ablums of all time. While arguably not the Beatles' best, ""Sergeant Pepper"" is probably their most important musical offering."
1,the beatles expand there horizons,to me this is the beatles finest hour. it all really comes together here. the blend there unique style with other forms of music. within you without you is great because it shows of harrison's passion for indian ragas. but for those who are more interested in strait beatles rock this has something for everyone. everybody loves the beatles. there just a timelss band.
1,1967...where were you!,"Right on Mr. Ford. This album, even if you hate it is worth the respect of serious music lovers, yes even classical music lovers. I do not own a Bob Dylan album, but I respect his talent and his influence on pop music and society. Think he influenced the Beatles at all?!?!? Sgt. Pepper is not my favorite Beatle album, but it is a classic and a must have for any one considering listening to the Beatles catalog. Because it is so far removed from MTV, it seems trite or maybe out-dated, but believe me, in 1967 it was a master piece of gigantic proportions, and is still five star listening material. It changed the way everyone made or listened to music. Yes, there is a reason why the Beatles are still popular, but do not hate them for it. Listen to their genius. Sgt. Pepper is good listening because it is well produced, well written and performed, and yes...it takes you back a little if you are old enough to have been there in 1967!"
1,you had to be there when it was released,"...to fully appreciate how revolutionary this record was. The advance press had everyone prepared for something out of the ordinary but Pepper was still a jaw dropper because it sounded so different from everything recorded before it. The biggest pop act in the biz ignored all conventions, including the love song, and ignored many recording and songwriting conventions in the bargain. As usual, the Beatles set the pace and everyone else worked like mad to catch up. The proof is in the songs, of course, and some people don't like the songs because the songs are generally about everyday experiences seen from new angles. Is this the greatest rock'n'roll record? To whom and who cares! It's a great record and that's good enough for me."
1,After reading several pages .....,"After reading several pages of reviews, I must admit that I also agree that this isn't necessarily the Beatles' best effort and that it may be somewhat over-rated. That being said, it's still a great album. It blows my mind when people say it's not as good as the music of today. They need to realize that this is actually the starting point for the best music of today. Kind of like saying you respect your next door neighbor who goes camping every weekend more than Lewis & Clark!"
1,"Did John Lennon /Paul McCartney, George Harrison, and Richard Starkey really write these songs?","This album is my #1 favorite album of all time! IMHO, all of these songs on SGT. PEPPER'S are way better than all of the other songs that the BEATLES ever ""wrote"". I am inclined to believe that some persons, other than the 4 BEATLES themselves, actually composed the music and lyrics to every song on SGT. PEPPER'S LONELY HEARTS CLUB BAND. I just can't believe Lennon/McCartney were capable of writing songs that are this excellent."
1,My Favorite,First of all the Beatles are my favorite band. I love just about all of the songs and cd's but this one is my favorite. I hope you will enjoy this cd as much as I did.
1,Best Beatles Album Ever!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"Sgt. Peppers Lonely Hearts Club Band is the best album ever made . I've listened to this album over and over again . And I would have to say I love every song on this album except for #8 which is written by george harrison . you just can' put a price on this album . If you are just starting to buy beatles music , I strongly suggest to start with this one.Over all i'd have to say if i could i would have given it 100 stars"
1,One of the greatest albums of all time,"Rock, jazz, you name it and Sgt. Pepper's has it. This album simply predicted every type of music to come and used every type of music played at the time. Every single track, each utterly unique, is a classic, incorporating the lyrical and musical genius of The Beatles. This album, simply put, is proof that the Beatles were and are the greatest band of all time.5 stars (without a doubt): Raw talent, sheer genius, unforgettable music. BUY IT NOW!"
1,Fantastic!,"I read some bad critics about the sound quality of this LP, but i'm not agree, not in my case because when i heard the complete record, the quality is AWESOME, incredible, crisp and clear, very happy with this vinyl!"
1,A Day in The Life.,"This album took pop music in a new direction and is one of my favorites.""A Day In The Life"", makes the album. And ""Its Getting Better"" is almost a perfect pop song. Some songs don't stand up as well as others like ""For The Benefit Of Mr Kite"". And overall it isn't as strong as the Beatles greatest album Ever ""Revovler"". But its definately worth adding to your collection."
1,He Who Hates Pepper Hates Music,"I'm sick of people with no musical appreciation dogging Sgt. Pepper. I'd like to see the guy from Oakland try and write a song like ""A Day In the Life"", ""When I'm 64"", or ""Within You Without You"". The same goes for everyone who gave this 1 or 2 stars! Those who can't, become critics! You don't have to like the album, but don't say it didn't take any creativity or talent to make, unless you can do better!"
1,This wasn't their concept,Whoever thought that this was their concept album was on crack. Rubber Soul was their concept. This was their middle masterpiece. MMT was good but this kicks that out the door. Mr. Kite dances around these walls like a madman. BUY IT!
1,an engaging beatles album,"I don't think any Beatles album lives up to the hype but still, you can not help but love Sgt. Pepper's. The Beatles' songs-writing was able to creating a picture with words and sound (Lucy in the Sky With Diamonds, A Day in the Life) as well as produce simple, concise pop songs that were both catchy and poignant (With a Little From My Friends, Getting Better). More than thirty years after release the album's tails of sexy meter maids and leaving a mundane home-life have offered some serious escapism for all of us lonely hearts."
1,Oldie but goodie,"What can I say about Sgt. Pepper? When I lost my turn table, I had to replace my albums. For a baby boomer this was a must have."
1,"Without this, where whould music be today?","Think about it. If it weren't for Sgt. Pepper, what would be rock music? What would it sound like? Would it even be around? This album is the greatest thing to ever happen to music since Beethoven. In fact, they are the Beethovens of the the 20th century. There is no way around it. So, for all you Heavy-Metal, Grunge rockers, remember-you don't have to like the Beatles music, but without this, you wouldn't be listening to anything of that sort. The Beatles showed the world something no one's ever seen before with this album. So, with that in mind, buy this CD."
1,Don't you think there's a reason for all the praise ?,"I'm a Beatles fan and I'm gonna confess something right now. Here it is : if you take each song separately, Sgt. Pepper is probably NOT the best Beatles' album (no big news, Ringo told it before me). It's possible that ""Revolver"" or ""Rubber Soul"", or the white album, or whatever you want, are better. I just say this to show that I'm not ""contaminated"" by the hype that makes people react and give it only one star. And now, listen to the title track and its reprise. Listen to ""With a little help from my friends"". Listen to ""Lucy in the sky with diamonds"". Listen to ""A Day In The Life"", the greatest piece of so-called ""popular"" music of the 20th century. I mean it. People will still be listening to it in centuries to come. And whatever you think of some of the other tracks (which are great too), admit that it's worth five stars just because of the ones I've mentioned..."
1,nostalgia for the sixties,"The bell bottoms were hideous, and so were the clogs with mini skirts we couldnt sit in. I would never ware those fashions again but the music is still good and the beatles were a part of everything."
1,The Best,"If one is a Beatles' fan, one won't be dissappointed. This was truly the best rock group ever."
1,Best Album of All Time,"This is my favorite Album of all time. It was ground breaking when it was released in 1967 (I was 13) and is still fun to listen to today. It had all the lyrics on the back cover. It covered all sorts of styles from hard rock (Sergeant Pepper) to sitar music with George, to pop deities like Lovely Rita and Getting Better. If you love rock/pop music and want something to make you feel alive and put a smile on your face, this is the CD to get."
1,essential,"Believe me,I'm by no meens a diehard Beatles fan(in fact I'm more into the Stones), but everyone should hear this album. If anyone is at all into or at least interested in the Beatles then they have heard this album. Is it important? YES! Is it good? LISTEN TO IT!"
1,YOU MUST HAVE THIS CD!,"It is not because I want to fit in with the majority that I say this is my favorite Beatle album and one of the best over-all of all time. It's because there are so many good songs on it. Out of the 13 tracks on this album, there is only ONE that I don't like (How many other albums can you say that about?), which is George's heavily Indian influenced ""Within You Without You."" The others are simply great and fun to listen to. One person on this board has said that songs such as ""Lovely Rita"" are ""silly,"" or that ""When I'm 64"" is ""hopelessly retro."" These are two of my favorite songs on the album BECAUSE of those qualities. Songs like these help you forget all the sometimes drab realities of life and just have FUN. Another of my favorites on here is ""Sgt. Peppers Reprise."" I usually don't like reprises, but this one just makes you want to get up and dance. If you own no other Beatle CD's, go out and get this one. You won't be disappointed. :-)"
1,A classic!,"Sgt.Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band has it all. Clever lyrics, catchy tunes, this is very Beatles. A must for any first time buyer, songs range from She's Leaving Home to the title song, to Within You Without you. Truly a Beatles classic."
1,THE BEATLES' MASTERPEICE,One of my all time favourite albums.I love the sound of it from beginning to end.No Beatles album collection would be complete without this album.
1,This is evolution at its best,"When you hear this album, you will be so amazed at the experimental level of the beatles. This album is not equal to any album you have heard and you will find that many groups have been very influence by these tracks. This is the beatles at their best. Excellent from begining to end. Highly recomended."
1,The Mecca of all recorded albums!,"Plain simple, this could be easily the best album ever recorded, just only for its influence. 40 years and still fresh and daring.This is The Beatles as you've never heard them before, or probably after (and the first ever album to have the lyrics printed in the back cover). Psychedelic, urban and extremely brilliant. Get this album and experience not just music, but a whole cultural movement.NOTE: Im not a blind fan, and I'll be clear. To me one song of the bunch doesn't work, and that'll be ""Good morning good morning"". The Anthology version is far superior and cleaner although the guitar solo in here is really awesome. Its just the string and horns arrangements and the weird farm animal sounds that seems very out of place. But anyway, in spite of that, this must be the most important album ever (even if by today's standars of music sounds pretty dull). Period."
1,This sacred cow is actually good,"I'm not much for worshipping sacred cows. I wouldn't call PET SOUNDS or DARK SIDE OF THE MOON masterpieces, even if ""the experts"" say that they are. And I don't really care if SGT PEPPER is the birth of modern pop music or important regarding the evolution of artrock.I just think that the songs on SGT PEPPER are really good. Good enough to get 5 stars."
1,Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band,"The main reason I got the Sgt. Pepper's album is because of the accolade that it's number uno on Rolling Stone's magazine of ""500 Greatest Albums of All Time,"" but I don't agree with them. It's a matter of opinion of course.You have your slow catchy melody ""With A Little Help From My Friends,"" a song I first heard by Joe Cocker, you got the classic ""Lucy In The Sky with Diamonds,"" you got your optimistic ""Getting Better,"" you got the spectacular rhythm of ""Fixing a Hole,"" and the rest of the songs take you on a creative journey. Other catchy Catchy songs that I liked were the wonder of ""When I'm Sixty-Four,"" upbeat ""Lovely Rita,"" the brilliant ""Good Morning, Good Morning,"" and the extraordinary last track."
1,Good But Overrated.,"The Beatles were one of the best bands around back then and still are today. It's essential and most of the songs are good but it's extremely overrated. I'd pick Revolver or Abbey Road over this any day. It was very unique for the time, that's why it's more popular. Some people don't like The Beatles because they think they're overrated. Their music is popular for a reason and most of their music's good, even their most overrated. It's not the very best though, their music before Sgt. Pepper doesn't get as much attention. Rubber Soul and Revolver are amazing, those are five star albums. Fixing A Hole, She's Leaving Home, A Day In the Life, When I'm Sixty Four and Sgt. Pepper are the best and are great songs however Lucy In The Sky With Diamonds and With A Little Help From My Friends are overrated in my opinion. After all this was one of the first albums in psychedelic rock and it popularized the genre but now it sounds outdated in parts. Revolver holds up with age much better."
1,The best Beatles Production,Sgt Pepper was a brilliantly conceived and produced LP way back in 1967.There is an amazing feel about the album.It has not a weak moment on it.All saying this I don't know why the MONO mix was not issued with this CD as it is stronger and has a better sonic sound than the stereo mix.
1,Lighten up on George...,"Mostly every review I've read was dissing George's song ""Within You Without You. Lighten up, it's not that bad of a song, I like it, & it's not that long neither, I've heard songs longer then that, & they're not bad. I wish George wrote some more tracks for this album, he's not a bad writer at all. I just got this album, & it's really nice.I like mostly every track on this album; I think the song ""With A Little Help From My Friends"" is so cute, I can play that song over & over again, it's a happy song. I also like the title track; & ""Getting Better"". ""She's Leaving Home"", is a nice song too. Overall, this album is very well done."
1,Stick with the Vynl,The songs don't flow like the vinyl. For example there is gap from SGT Pepper's lonely hearts band to With a little help from friends. The vinyl version flows right into the song were as the CD there is a silent gap.The packaging is nice and yes it's better that the CD versions from 20 years ago. But the Vinyl version is still better.
1,Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band,"I think that Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band is the Beatles' best album. I first heard this album when I was six and after I heard it I wanted to hear other Beatles albums like Help! and A Hard Day's Night (both great albums). There is not even one standard song in Sgt. Pepper's, every song is great."
1,"Timely, timeless.","I agree with the reviewers that say it is pointless to review this album. But the Beatles' music makes me at least want to take the opportunity to say ""Wow."" Sgt. Pepper is both timely and timeless. The forays into sound experiments were certainly influential and intriguing in their time (and in many instances, still intrigue) but strip all the production away and you're still left with wonderful songs. Great melodies, engaging lyrics...in fact, one of the great accomplishments of the Beatles was how incredibly well their music complements their lyrics to create something even greater as a whole. Whether you like the Beatles or not, whether you like Sgt. Pepper or not is, as always, a matter of personal taste. But you're doing yourself a great disservice if you don't listen to their music and listen again. This album is so inventive, so solid, so well-crafted, so influential and so enduring you would have to be arrogant or small-minded indeed to give it anything but a top rating."
1,A truly creative masterpiece..but it sounds better in MONO,"All I can really say is....If you like this stereo mix....You will probably like REVOLVER and MAGICAL MYSTERY TOUR as well....it isn't that hokey ""music-left/vocals-right"" wannabe stereo that I have been ragging about....This is actually listenable and enjoyable....The remastering job is pretty good...The biggest flaw is that it tends to be a bit too airey...Some people (me included) have stated they prefer the MONO version of this album.....but unless you are prepared to buy the COMPLETE REMASTERED CD SET in MONO (which is pretty costly)...You better stick with this version.....as you wont find the mono version anywhere else.....until they decide to issue the MONO versions individually.I would say....All in all...it's worth the investment."
1,Best album ever,This without a doubt is the greatest album ever. It got me into music. This album changed my life. MUSICS finest hour.
1,"A true classic, but not the best.","I don't usually tend to agree with the idea that this album is the greatest album of all-time. Don't get me wrong, there are some great songs on this album that were made into even bigger hits by other artists then they were for the Beatles(Elton John:""Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds,"" Joe Cocker:""With a Little Help from my Friends""). However, there is no doubt in my mind that this is not the greatest album of all-time. Other then the two songs that I just listed, other good songs featured on this album are the title track,""Getting Better,"" ""Fixing a Hole,"" and one of my personal favorite Beatle songs ""A Day in the Life."" Any song that is about an LSD trip has got to be great. Other than those songs the rest of album is pure filler. It's not necessarily there worst set of songs but it's certainly not their best. Nevertheless, Sgt. Pepper will always go down in history."
1,Brilliant,"This is a great album. To someone earlier who said Hendrix was better: consider what Paul McCartney said, ""The greatest compliment was when I saw Jimi Hendrix play a club in London, and SGT. PEPPER had been out only 2 days. And Hendrix opened the show playing the song SGT. PEPPERS LONELY HEARTS CLUB BAND."" So even Hendrix liked this album. If he liked it, the rest of us who like it must have pretty good taste."
1,Guaranteed to raise a smile,"Does the world really need another review of this album? Probably not, but I will add my two cents, anyway. As most people are probably aware, this album always ranks at or near the top of any poll taken about the greatest albums of all time. There is a good reason for that, because this album is a masterpiece. Is it the Beatles best album? Maybe yes, maybe no. It's hard to say, because the Beatles have 5 or 6 other albums that are contenders for ""Greatest Album of All Time"". There isn't really a consensus among Beatles fans as to what their best album is. Anyway, this album definitely belongs in every serious music fan's collection."
1,Revisit every few years!,"A superb album. Used to listen to it non-stop when making jigsaws with my Dad when I was young. Brings back fantastic memories.To enjoy it properly, leave it a few years before you listen to it again. The longer you leave it, the more you enjoy hearing it again!"
1,this is the best album EVER!,"I'm only fourteen and recently found myself knee-deep in Beatles. I love every song, and all the songs. I've never even heard most of the songs the Beatles did and yet i LOVE all of this CD.the weird thing is that the whole Segerant peper's band thing came from wanting to be normal - like not be super stars!!! Like they thought it acutally might have worked!!!"
1,It's getting better all the time,"Ok, I may not understand the full context, having been born in the late '80's, but this album is still very wonderful. Personal favorites were ""She's Leaving Home"", ""Getting Better"", ""Within You Without You"", and ""A Day in the Life"", although I think all the songs were good, even if sometimes seeming a bit...well...weird, like what I'm about to tell you. I wanted to write this to warn that at the end of the CD (or LP) just after ""A Day in the Life"" is a dog whistle that can be heard by humans (especially on the CD) and that I find very annoying followed by some very interesting...erm...talk/laughing."
1,What else can I say,Bought this record brand new to add to our collection and the husband loved it. Can't go wrong with a Beatles album!
1,Everone Should have this album,I love this album.I just love the images I get in my head when I listen to it. You just feel good listening to it!
1,The Greatest Album Ever!,"I was reading the other reviews here, and the kid is the only one who gets it right. This is a terrific album! If you're like me and the weird, trippy Beatles music is your favorite, this album is for you! Don't listen to those other people, they're crazy! Buy it and enjoy it!""A Day in the Life,"" is my favorite Beatle song, by the by."
1,Timeless,"The Beatles produced so much great music that it is difficult to say which album of their's I like the most.Though there will be debates, Sgt Peppers is one of the albums that I consider a must have of their studio records. From the opening of the title track until the reprise it is clear why this is one of the classic records of all time.With such well known songs as ""With A Little Help From My Friends"" and ""Lucy In The Sky With Diamonds"" some other songs ""Being For The Benefit of Mr. Kite"" get overlooked. From the humorous and thoughtful ""When I'm Sixty Four"" to the haunting ""She's Leaving Home"" and ""A Day In The Life"" this record shows the range that makes The Beatles so special in rock."
1,The greatest of the greats!,"Frankly, the album has obviously secured itself the ""classic"" title. Honestly, how could it not? While many feel it to be over-rated and pretentious, the impact it had on pop-culture, and the impact it continues to have, is simply massive. It is a fair assumption that there will never be another band like the Beatles, and by extension another album like Sgt. Pepper. While this is rather sad, it's also for the best. Anyone who loves the album shouldn't have a problem with this fact, as they can simply put on Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band; thirty-nine minutes of music that changed the world."
1,Country meets jazz/surf,"Redd Volkeart's album No Stranger to a Tele (a play on The Strangers, Merle Haggard's band, which Redd plays lead guitar in) shows off his wide range of influences, from 40's jazz to songs that sound like they came from a Ventures album. Everything has a basic honky tonk counrty base, naturally, but the instrumentals (my favorites by far) have a wide pallette of sounds from Redd-hot chicken pickin' to Charlie Christian to whammy pedal driven surf licks Nokie Edwards would be proud of. When Redd sings he has a nice, smooth old-time country baritone voice. He's not quite Merle, but them who is? All in all, fans of tasteful Telecaster guitar will find this a true delight."
1,Explicit Phonics Instructions!,"Covers teaching the phonetic structure of correct English spelling and initial letter formation, in 4 of the first 9 weeks of instruction atGrade 1 level or at 1/2 that pace for kindergarten students. This is ""explicit"" phonics instruction (teaching the phoneme/grapheme relationshipsin isolation) using multi-sensory, direct and Socratic teaching techniques.For ages 5-95 and virtually all ability-level students; primary students (K - 3) should have teacher/parent assistance. These can be used alone,but work well with the tape."
1,Our grandson loved it!,"I ordered this book after meeting the author in New Orleans; he graciously invited us, a couple of strangers, into his house. He later mentioned that he had written this book for children. I ordered it from Amazon and we gave it to our 4, nearly 5 year old grandson. It seemed to be about right for his age group. He loved it, and we had to read it aloud to him several times. The book has beautiful illustrations, too."
1,A Dirty Deed,"""A Dirty Deed"" is a great sequel to the first book ""Across the Steel River"". I was caught up once again in the lives of the two young boys as they fought to overcome ignorance, prejudice and injustice - and of course, the most powerful, evil man in their hometown. Through scrapes, fights, dog attacks and narrow escapes, the characters learn something about themselves, and the men they want to become. The interaction between the boys is delightful. Their rough and tumble comraderie brought many a smile to my face. There is also a powerful moral lesson to be learned about shame and how it can prevent people from embracing those closest to them. ""A Dirty Deed"" is a book that can be enjoyed by anyone, young or old, male or female. The storyline will pull you in until you find you can't put the book down until you finish it."
1,"Magical, mesmerizing, leaves you spellbound....","I've heard so much of Francesca Lia Block and this is the first book I bought which was written by her. Her writing style is beautiful and unique. Tt makes you want to just go on reading and not stop. ""I Was a Teenage Fairy"" tells a story about a girl who, with the help of her fairy friend, Mab, explore the wide world out there and overcome obstacles in life.However, I found the book to be slightly confusing at times. Block used a lot of ""metaphorical"" language and it sometimes seemed as if the story line was not clear enough. I didn't quite like the ending because I found it too ""rushy"". Everything just ended with a woosh, like when someone talks without pausing to breathe. One thing that bothered me was that there was no specific ""ending"" to the relationship between Barbie and her mother. Instead, it focused more on the ""transformation"" of Barbie to Selena Moon. Overall, it's still a good book and will leave you feeling all magical inside."
1,best book ever,this is one of the best pieces of writing i have ever read in my life. the description is fabulous and every word written sounds like a song. its beautiful and fantastic and undescribable how wonderful this writing is. read this book now if u appreciate good descriptive writing.
1,Drink it up fast and deep,"I don't know how she does it but she does and her writing comes out liquid and dripping of Ambrosia so sweet that you drink deep and deeper until there isn't any left and then all you have left to do is sit back and sigh.Her writing style is like ""extract of novel"" mixed with sugarary syrup. She takes the horrible things that give us nightmares and makes them fantastical.When you read I Was A Teenage Fairy, you won't even know which parts of the story are real and which part the story teller is embelishing on. In truth the whole book could be pure fantasy, but there will be a little nagging voice in the back of your mind whispering ""what if...?"" the whole way through.Worth a sip or two or three..."
1,uNiQuE & sPuNkY!,"I thought that this book was a lot of fun to read. I enjoyed all the characters very much, but my favorite was Mab (a pinkie-sized fairy). She was so spunky and truthful, what's not to love about a mini teenage girl that speaks her mind? The story itself was tragic, but with characters such as Mab, Barbie, Griffin, and Todd, it was a very exciting and colorful book to read. I recommend it to anyone who is interested in modern fairytales and likes to be entertained."
1,The Best Book I Have Read...,this book was the best one from all books I have read..It's about a girl named barbie who..NOOO im not telling what's it about..you go get it..you'll love it..really..trust me.. :) READ IT!! you'll really enjoy it..
1,inspiring,"This is such a beautiful book. Francesca Lia Block appeals to Y/A in this book, and demonstrates the growth of a girl and self-confidence with her vivid use of the english language and symbolism. If I was ever to have a daughter, I would want her to read this book."
1,I was a Teenage Fairy,"'I was a Teenage Fairy' was a really good book. It's a really good book and the little fairy in the book is cute.The fairy is 13 years old and has an attitude, but changes it through the book.Francesca Lia Block is a good writer and she makes me want to read another one of her books!"
1,I was a Teenage Fairy,"'I was a Teenage Fairy' was a really good book. It's really adventurist and the little fairy in the book is cute.The fairy is 13 years old and has an attitude, but changes it through the book.Francesca Lia Block is a good writer and she makes me want to read another one of her books!"
1,fairy of a teenage girl,"I Wasa a Teenage Fairy by Fransesca Dia Block was a very magical, invigorating, bizarre, and startling story. I loved this story.

1,"Best, most enjoyable,classic, intriguing book I've ever read","First off, let me start off by warning you. Once you start reading this book, you'll never be able to put it down. It was written so well. Aside from the fairy, its very realistic and modern. It's so great. Its a very great book, i recomend you read it. Although it does have some sex things going on and lots of bad language. Get it today!"
1,"If you Grew up in Chicago,you'll remenber Bob Stroud on radio","I got this CD because I have most of the other CD's in this series. You can get more song in other CD's,but these have a Chicago feel.Some song are hard to find ,that's what makes these CD's stand out."
1,Not just for spinners!,"I discovered this book as a beginning spinner, and I was thrilled with the opportunity to see so many different small projects which would let me experiment with a variety of yarns. I soon realized that I kept coming back to it for information on knitting techniques, for inspiration for gifts, and for the well designed small projects. The editors inspired me to branch out in my knitting, to try hats and socks, and to try new techniques in my spinning as well. Although each project is designed by a spinner for handspun yarn (and includes information on spinning a suitable yarn), the editors also provide excellent recommendations for substituting commercially available yarns"
1,homespun happiness,"If you are a handspinner of wool yarns, this book is an invaluable resource. Many patterns written for use with commercial yarns simply don't work with handspun. The patterns in this little book are classic, adaptable, and well suited to the special characteristics of hand made yarns, which tend to be less elastic and ""drapey"" than factory products. They also work well when knitted oversize and then felted. I refer to Homespun Handknit frequently, and the family mitten pattern is one I've made in homespun dozens of times, always with excellent results."
1,"benny scott , belgian fan of the 50's music","Great compilation !!!Most important fact : these are the ORIGINAL MONO RECORDINGSof most of Pat's great hits ( with the exception of April Love,in stereo on the CD, but exactly the same version as on the original 45 PM in mono. This means that the song was recorded in stereo but originally released in mono, but was not re-recorded in 1959 ! )Today most of Pat's big hits are released in the re-recorded stereo-versions of 1959. Only the German "" Big Bear Family "" company issued a boxed set "" The Fifties Complete "" containing also all the original mono and stereo-re-recordings of 15 songs.This double CD "" Pat's 40 Big Ones "" was probably issued with the permission of Big Bear Family Records.A REAL MUST for all Pat Boone fans who want the original recordings in true mono !!"
1,This is the BEST book ever!,"I was so excited when I got the book! I read it as soon as I got home and finshed it in like 2 hours! I don't know how to describe it! It was the best book I have read in my entire life, and I'm a heavy reader! This book kept me on the edge of my seat! As soon as I finshed it I e-mailed all my friends about the book! I would recomend that everyone should read this book. If they don't they're missing out on a lot of exciment! :)"
1,One of my favorite albums of all time,This album changed the way I listened to music forever and introduced me to the most interesting artist and songwriter of our time. Catchy pop tunes and delightful vocals mixed with a great peace message. And the remixed version sounds so much better than the original vinyl release that I simply can't believe it. This would definitely be one of my 'desert island discs'.
1,Apparently their tasty!,"I have bought several different brands of pig ears. Most seem to use a tanning process in which the pig ears get soft, mushy, and smell horrible.These pig ears actually smell like pork and their crispy. My 10 week old puppy is able to devour a pig ear in one sitting.My pup will knaw on most pig ears for a few minutes and then give up on them while moaning and groaning in frustration.She can actually eat these ears from start to finish!"
1,In a pig's ear,"Pig ears must be to dogs what chocolates are to humans. My vet recommends them instead of rawhide, and I've never been sorry."
1,Tya - Tribal Sutras,"This is global fushion music inspired by the Australian aboriginals and envokes a memory of our origins.The rhythms and chorus will make you want to move. Songs titled Baime, Awake To Your Senses, and The Mosque are among my favorites, but the entire CD is excellent. If you are fond of the group ""Deep Forest"", then you are really in for a satisfying treat.Not for the uncultured [mundane] ear."
1,The Secrets of the Light,I recommend this book to everyone. I've read Dannion's two other books and this goes right along with them.
1,Superb,"This album works well as a continuous listen as well as each individual piece being excellent. Sound quality is good. This is my third Ayler recording purchase, the first being theVibrationsLP and the second theSpiritual UnityCD. I rate this album far higher than Spiritual Unity which I find aesthetically spartan and simplistic. For a couple of good versions of Ghosts, a tune which is absent on this compilation I would recommend the Vibrations album (with Don Cherry, Gary Peacock, and Sonny Murray) which is a killer and also available as a used CDVibrations- click this to read others reviews of this album."
1,Not bad,This isn't a bad workout. It gets your heartrate up but a lot like workouts I have done before. Not too advanced but more intermediate.
1,Mixes things up,"The reason I really like this workout is because it alternates between cardio and weights. It gives me a chance to catch my breath and cool down, while also working on my strength! But there is also an option to do just the cardio portion of the DVD, which I have been doing lately because I like to do my own strength training, as it is more advanced. The cardio is great, gets me sweating, and it's defnintely not as daunting or boring as a long run. Jari Love is an excellent trainer because she is very warm and kind in encouraging viewers, instead of being too tough or mean. She also places an emphasis on the fact that it's okay if you can't finish the exercise or need to take it down to the first level. We can't all be perfect and finish a difficult circuit, and she understands that!"
1,Just what I needed!,"This is my favorite Jari Love workout! I've been wanting a great intense cardio program and this is it! You have the option of weights or cardio or both, on my off day this is a fabulous cardio. I just received my dvd and couldn't wait to try it, I was not disappointed! I have not done the weight training yet, that has to wait until tomorrow, but I am sure it will not disappoint!! LOVE IT!52 yr old female.I have now worked out to the whole dvd. It is amazing. Jari is motivational and right on. I have had to turn the volume down on some of her dvd's but you will want to hear everything she says on this one! The workout is easily modified to your level and ability but you will have fun working up to the level Jari and her team are at. My modifications still give me a tremendous workout. I believe I am finally going to kick menopause in the butt and lose weight and get fit with this workout! Thank you Jari Love!!!"
1,Brilliant,"I have most of Jari Love's dvds and this is definitely one of the best. I cannot recommend it enough. I also have a lot of other fitness dvds and Jari Love is simply the best. If you are considering buying a fitness dvd definitely get this one, you will not regret it."
1,The CD thats included is a plus,"One of the things that I found extraordinarily helpful with this product is that it comes with a CD-Rom, which allows you to actually customize the contracts to your liking.When using the CD-Rom that comes with this book, you can go into each contract and add your company and/or other parties names, agreed %, dollar amounts, special agreed upon terms and just about anything else that you need to add, and then print the contract out directly from your printer, giving you an agreement that is fully customized and professional looking.I also found this thing to be extremely easy to use and self explanatory - No law degree needed.Talk about convenience!!! You can't beat it."
1,great,"What a great way to get everything organized and running smoothly. This book is the thing that saved me from mayhem and ithank God and the writer for its existence. I've always had trouble with understanding contracts and the thing that stoped me and my company from faster speeds was the paperwork, not the excelent coding my employes did. A great book with great explanations, a definite buy"
1,Good book!,I have a software company and we had a lot of problems searching about legal stuff and that sort of thing. Some of my emploees came to me one day and showed me this book.I thanked him and started reading it. It's great and it has a lot of information that anyone can use. I saved a lot of time and also a lot of money with this book. Really good one!
1,best on the market,"This pack is the best thing that I bought, it helped me sort out and understand the contracts i was given and was signing. I no longer need advice from anyone, I can understand these terms easily now and I’m no longer in danger of being scammed"
1,Almost perfect,"Nothing compares to this masterpiece and I have laid my eyes on many such titles and haven't seen anything like it. It's the best collection of contracts on the market, complete with guidelines and advice. The print is beautiful and every point is explained in detail and the book even includes a section of advice on how to be successful as an individual in the IT world. Overall a great title with contracts and pre prints that you can actually use, don't spend your money on something else, this is it"
1,Nothing Else Even Compares!,"This book is excellent!Ignore the negative review that was given by that one person, if you check his history, you'll notice that he has given poor reviews of several other books sold on Amazon.com... Some people just have nothing positive to say about anything in life.This is a great book and I highly recommend it."
1,Freelancer,I work as a freelance website designer. I can't afford to hire people to write anything for me so this book/CDROM was a huge lifesaver. I really appreciate that I can edit the contracts to my liking but they still look professional! A great help!
1,I like starts,"My daughter loves these. Work great so far after a month with no dulling in brightness. Although I wish I bought a bigger pack. In a room that is 8x12 there is just enough stars, but we want to cover more."
1,Great and lasting glow in the dark stars,Bought this set to decorate up the room for my baby boy and I really love it. It was bright enough in the dark yet not too bright to make my boy sleepless.
1,Fascinating book,Using Language is a great way to learn more of what you didn't know you already know about language and the mind.
1,great for babies,I buy these for my baby (17months). you can melt them in a bottle of milk. good product.
1,My baby loves these,"I have searched high and low for good baby cookies and these are exactly what I was looking for, they are hard enough that they don't crumble or get slimy right away. My baby loves them. I think they are much better than the thin rice wafers that are carried in many stores now. They are pricey but you get a lot in a box. I think they are worth it."
1,Brings out the nature lover in all of us,"This books explores ways in which we can substitute man-made materials for those that are found in nature, offering the reasons why nature is almost alwasy best. The book is aimed towards a contemporary design oriented audience, but the ideas can be adjusted to fit most decors. Beautifully photographed and well written, this book is a great addition to any design library."
1,My son loves this!!! Colourful!,"I bought this last week. Assembling was very easy, hardly took 15 mins. My son now sits only on this since it's very colourful. Excellent for kids 1.5-6 yrs. He plays in this, writes, colours everything on this now. Some times he drags this all the way to living room to watch tv sitting on this chair. He likes to sit on this more than $2000 worth of sofa set. I recommand this to all kids of similar age."
1,cute and sturdy.,"I bought this when it was on sale for 15 bucks. My 16 month old son likes to play with the drawer. He always pulls the drawer out and try to figure out on how to put it back in. I placed this set in his bedroom and it looks really cute in there, but my son will take the stool in the living room so he can sit on it while having fruit snacks or crackers, or while watching Little Einstein. The other stool is in my bedroom (I am using it as a step stool)."
1,The All-Around Horse And Rider by Donna Snyder Smith,"The All-Around Horse And Rider by Donna Snyder Smith makes me wish I could go back and do my equestrian life all over again... to do it right! I learned about horses during the summers when I was 10,11&12 by spending my days at Fairmount Riding Stable. I never had a lesson until I was married. Once I owned a horse, I read a number of ""how-to"" books... but I found it difficult to put the information into actuality. Enter The All- Around Horse And Rider... I think it should be retitled as:The Novice Rider's Bible - or - How To Become An Accomplished EquestrianIf I had had access to this wonderfully good book of discerning advice, I would have learned before my mistakes, instead of from them. The best part of riding was becoming one with a horse... being a team... looking after one another. This information packed book, so full of simple, basic and insightful advice, can help riders of all disciplines to do exactly that. Marie Weber"
1,Working on my feet and needing quality shoes,"I am on my feet 12 or more hours a day. Cement floors and high activity have destroyed multiple sets of shoes. I have bough some brands and totaled them in 3-4 months. The only thing showing wear is the finish. The toes are scuffed up from crawling and moving around working on equipment. If there is work to be done I am all over it. My shoes better be prepared to take it all. These Wolverines are comfortable and solidly built.When I do finally give them more then they can handle, I will be buying another set to replace them. I would love a more durable toe area for lasting beauty but I don't want to give up the comfort that these shoes offer to my hard working feet."
1,Happy memories,"For many reasons,1985 was the happiest time of my life...and when I think of that year, immdeiately Level 42's ""World Machine"" comes to mind. The album features a wonderful blend of that unique jazz/funk sound which fans came to know, love and really only identify with the band, as well as some deep, and seemingly very personal moments. Such tracks as ""Lying Still"" and ""Good Man in a Storm"" (incidently, my favoutites from the album) leave a most eerie yet calming refrain. Two massive hits, ""Something About You"" (which went top 10 in the USA) and ""Leaving Me Now"" feature on the album This is a record that grows on you the more it's played. Try it, friends....you won't regret it! Phil MURRAY"
1,"Excellent--full of passion, love and feeling!",I would say that Level 42 and their music is one of the most underrated bands ever. To this day they still have a huge following through their e-mail fan club. The lyrics and the music are sheer genius. Give it an opportunity and you will agree! Many of us go through good/bad times in relationships and life. Level 42 does a great job of relating their music with personal circumstances. I have yet to have anyone dislike Level 42 and their music. Mark King is the bass player and lead vocalist. The CD sounds excellent both indoors as well as in the car. E-mail me if you have any questions. Take care--
1,One of the best ever,L42 was one of the best groups out there and this is probably their best album. Just get it. You won't regret.
1,World Machine Level 42,"Back in the eighties I was really into Level 42, (yes, I know that's Mark King, I just typo'ed it and couldnt figure out how to fix that...) I played their music for hours when I was younger, I don't know why but I just stopped playing them, but also most of the other music I enjoyed back then, Recently while with a friend a song came on the radio ""Something About You"", I instantly fell in love with the band, this was one of my favorite CD's back then, and when I couldnt find it in my collection, nor any of the other Level 42 discs I knew I had, I went all out and bought them all over again, again one track especially on the WORLD MACHINE my all time favorite, ""Something About You'.....really ""something about"" this song, and every other song on this CD, You won't be disappointed, really."
1,Fusoid Funk band,"Level 42, a fusion-esque funk band w/minor pop flavorings before this 1986 offering, manages to keep much of its roots in this top-40 essenced album. ""Something About You"" deserves its top-10 spot, and the remake of ""Hot Water"" is much better than the original (its video was featured on BET often when it debuted). Band head Mark King's extraordinary bass abilities fit well w/most of the album's tunes, especially ""Good Man in a Storm."" The only song that prevents 5 stars from me is the overly preachy, dreadful ""The Chant Has Begun."""
1,Simply incredible!!!!,"Level 42 is simply incredible and the fact that they aren't more popular often baffles me. Yes they are big-- but with such incredible playing and songwriting they were on another level indeed (maybe even Level 42! ), when compared to their peers-- they should have been HUGE!If you want great, commercially accessible music, with great musicianship and production, World Machine is a must have.If you love music, World Machine is a must have.The double disc is great because it shows how incredibly talented the band is live and in the studio."
1,Engrossing!,"I just saw this movie this morning on the big screen at the Bend Film Festival: I highly recommend it. The filmmakers used archival photographs and films of this devastating event, documenting what happened soon after the 53 second earthquake: fires, exacerbated by the dynamite that was used supposedly to prevent fires. The parallels with the response to Katrina in New Orleans can't be ignored: decades of warnings by experts and smaller natural disasters; building homes in unsafe areas or without regard to how residents would be evacuated, etc.See this film."
1,always the one i reach for first,"I grew up on Folk and Peter, Paul and Mary.This album has always been a mix of styles and emotions and social issues.I agree with other reviewers that it is an emotional ride with each song asking the listener to consider how they feel about some social issue or humanity itself.This album every time i hear it reminds me how i have changed on how i feel about what is better and what should be. It makes me question should i try again to return to my more open altruistic beliefs.All said the album does the things MUSIC is supposed to do enlighten, challenge, bring out emotions.""..standing next to me in this lonely crowd...is a man who swears he's not to blame...all day long i hear his voice shouting so loud...shouting out that he was framed...i've seen my light come shining..."""

1,good deal,"this item arrived in a timely manner as well as in excellent condition, thanks for the integrity of delivering such a good service."
1,I love This Book!!!!!!!,"I love this book. It shows not only the love and loyalty that can exist between siblings no matter what they do, but it shows what lengths a person might go to survive. My favorite charaicter was Nikolas because despite his bad reputation he really is a sweetheart, when you haven`t threatened him or some he cares about. He will do anything to protect the people he cares from physical or emotional help. That is why I give this book 5 star."
1,Amelia did it again,Once again Amelia has brought us to her world of vampires and witches. Like her previous two I was unable to put Shattered Mirror down. Introducing us to more of the witches side of things was a great thing. And I hope we get to see more of our favorite vampire Aubrey in the future. If you like any books with vampire lore in it I surely suggest all three of her books.
1,Loved It,"This was the first Amelia Atwater Rhodes book I read, and it made me go out and buy all her books. She is one of my favorite author. I cant wait to read the sequel All Just Glass."
1,Shattered Mirror,"Shattered Mirror was an awesome book!! It really keeps you interested in it and it lets you use your own creativity. I thought the storyline of this book was interesting!! I really liked learning about the different veiws peopel have on things. Forexample when the vampires thought different from the witches and then the humans were kind of clueless as to what is going on. It was also interesting when in one part of the book there was a group that had all humans, vampires, and withces united together as one! The book really makes you think and it tought me that not all people have the same veiws on life and how it should work! It is a great drama also... I couldn't wait to see what was going to happen to Meilinda when she was out hunting for vampires and then I also was paying attention to the thing going on between her and Christopher!! Overall I would give this book 4 stars and would reccomend it to anyone interested in vampires and fantasy!! It's a great book to read and get into!"
1,I loved this book!,This was the very first book i read from Ameila and let me say it had my attention from the start...when i was a teenager at least! First off if anyone wants a good read for adults..look in the adult section for that! But for teenagers this is a good book! I loved all the characters in the book and i couldnt put it down but once again it was a short read but a good read!
1,Wonderful!!,"Sarah is the daughter of a powerful vampire hunter. And that is why she is upset to find there are two vampires in her new school. Things only get worse when she begins to care for them.When she finds them at a bash and they admit what they are...even though she knew all along, she knows she is going to have to make them leave her alone.When Sarah picks the wrong fight and loses she is intent on killing Nickols. But that is easier said then done. And if Sarah makes another mistake it could change things forever...Personally i thought this was the best vampire/vampire hunter book ever! It had lots of action and the characters I really loved. Even the ""bad"" one. There was even some romance and mystery.Great!!"
1,Wonderful,"I loved this book and I definitely give it five stars! However, I found it to have a slight lack of detail in several instances. I looked past that and enjoyed the book, though, and I recommend it highly!"
1,Not as good as the others,"This was a good book, but not as good as the other books by this author. the romance came in a little late, but that was about it. i reccomend this book for anyone who likes the other books by this author."
1,Great Book!,"The book ""Shattered Mirror"" is really great. If you're interested in vampires, witches, demons, ect., you should defiantly read this book."
1,GOOD book,"shattered mirror is the 3rd in a semi-series of books by Amelia Atwater that are all slightly intertwined with each other. The book was good. I read it in about 2 dayz, a total of about 6 hours, and i couldnt put it down until i knew what happend. The cliff hanger at the end really leaves us wanting to know what happend, but all in all, its a good book."
1,Interesting plot,this novel was not at all amelia's best but it was a very interesting novel with a mixture of love and hatred among peers and creatures! she didn't quite have that same dark haunting style in this novel and that is what i like best about her writing so i was a little disappointed but it was a pretty delicious novel to read. If you are into romance and breaking the rules
1,What I Thought,"I thought this book, Shattered Mirror, was a good book with a unpredictable ending. The witch in the book, Sarah Vida, is a vampire hunter. She is trying to find the vampire Nickolas. Everything is fine until she goes to school and ends up befriending two vampires. When her sister finds out about their relationship, Sarah runs into a problem, ruin the relationship with her friends or family.I liked the book. It kept me guessing and it was never boring. The ending is unexpected and unpredictable. The perfect book!"
1,Highly Recommended,"This was such a great book. I loved the characters, even the antagonist Nikolas. I would recommend this book to anyone who loves supernatural novels. Again, it was awesome!"
1,If it wasnt the same thing.,"The reviewer below said it was the same as another live recordong. I wouldnt know, beacuse this is my first George Thorogood cd. Anyway Im sure he's probably right. So if it wasnt for that, I think it is a great album to own. i think he did really good live. So if you dont have {Live In 99}, dodnt get this.Review By Michael Peters."
1,Thorogood - Extended,An excellent album or cd. I use it especially for workouts. George is a all out rocker and almost all the songs are especially hammering. I always recommend this album
1,I love my Sony telephone,"This specific telephone was recommended to me by my nephew. It meets my needs. It has dual key pads on the base and hand held unit which is important. Also has dual I.D. displays which again is important. I opted to have the caller I.D. amenity added to my phone bill and this is the only one that I have or need at this time in my life...If I take the hand unit with me to another room in my apartment, I can still see who is calling and I can also auto dial from that unit. I love my Sony telephone!"
1,A *must* for every Windows BASIC programmer,"As good as Daniel Appleman's book is, I guess most publishers and authors felt writing a competing book wasn't worth the effort. Thanks goodness neither the author, nor Wrox felt that way.This book is not a replacement for Appleman's book. But it sure is a lot easier to read and makes a great companion. It's better organized, allowing you to search for API entries based on the type of task you want to overcome.This is the author's first effort, so it's only 360+ pages. Not bad. If I were to offer one complaint, it would be that there is no companion CDROM. At $40 (retail), it's odd for a computer book not to include one."
1,Great Book for those starting out with the API,"If you are new to VB or just haven't used the API much and ready to start this is a great book for you. It is inescabable that this book is compared to Appleman's book which is the definitive work on API's but while I have the Appleman book I find that it is better for people who are already somewhat experinced and want to learn more. This book by Jason Bock is THE book to buy if you are starting out. Not to say it is a 'API for Dummies' type of book -API usage is a non-trivial subject- but this will give you the foundation you need in a much more digestible fashion. The Appleman book which I occasionaly dig out to try to figure out something, spends most of its time as a paperweight since I am still something of a newbie. This book by Jason I am actually using to learn."
1,Excellent book to get you started actually doing it.,"While Appleman's book continues to be the definitive =reference= book. This book offers some real world examples of how to use the Win32 API to not only do things that you can't do with VB intrinsic commands and controls, but also to subtantially boost the performance of things you could do with regular VB. Specific examples are worked through and type conversions are explained within this context.I'd recommend it to anyone that's thinking the API might have something more to offer than current directory information (they'd be right).I wouldn't use every example in real life, but there are plenty I would use, and all are excellent examples of what can be done.DISCLAIMER: I was a technical reviewer on this book, and, as such, am somewhat tied to Wrox and the quality of the end product. Rest assured, however, that I don't get any perks from this review, and the opinion is mine and mine alone.Rob Vieira, MCSD, MCT"
1,THIS ALBUM IS DA BOMB!,"This album is everything a hip hop fan ever wanted! The songs are well-made, creative, and hilarious at the same time! Buy it & you will NOT, repeat NOT be disappointed!"
1,A Must-Have,"If you're in your mid 20's and a true Hip-hop head, then you can relate to how this album depicted a typical week in your life at the time it was released. With references, (sometimes not so subtle) to the culture of blunt-loving teenagers just trying to make it in spite of what we thought was a world against us, the comedic aspect is paramount. The truth is, many teenagers poke fun at issues to help them get through rough times...relationships, sex, (self-imposed or otherwise) confrontations with peers or the police. All are issues we dealt with regularly, (in my case) in much the same manner as The Pharcyde. This album is more than music to me, it's a depiction of a way of life that I look back on now with warm & fuzzy reflection."
1,One of the best rap albums ever,"Bizarre Ride is one of the best rap albums ever made. The beats are fresh and off-kilter, the lyrics are clever and largely devoid of the pathetic self-aggrandizement and mindless hatred that largely passes for substance today, and the entire disk comes together in a way which feels as fresh and original now as it did back in 1993. While Pharcyde's two follow-up albums are still above-average, the group was never able to recapture the creative spark of Bizarre Ride. Highly recommended."
1,"It's called ""Summer in the City""","The sample Pharcyde uses in 'Passing Me By' is called ""Summer in the City"" from a 1969 out-of-print Quincy Jones album entitled I Heard That. You may find this cut on some other recent releases with various artists."
1,Exactly what I wanted,I've searched for this CD for years in-stores to no avail. Product arrived within a reasonable time-frame. I'm completely satisfied with my purchase
1,Best Group Ever,yes sir! passin me by indeed pharcyde needs to get more recognized like organized konfusion and souls of mischeif10 of 10 lyrics 10 of 10 beats
1,"""Dog Speak"" Speaks to Me","I have just finished reading ""Dog Speak"" by Bash Dibra and found it extremely helpful. As an animal artist who prefers to paint from life, I frequently need to advise my clients on basic obedience for their pets. Mr. Dibra has written his book for pet owners and not professional trainers so it is easy to read. I have painted dogs of every breed and description and when owners used the techniques I recommended from this book I noticed a considerable change in the pet's behavior on subsequent sittings. There are no frills or controversial new training methods here, just solid, proven advice. It is a must for every first time dog owner or anyone who just wants to review the basics."
1,Required reading,"Dog Speak is a must read for anyone who has a dog or loves dogs. This book is animated with the words that lead to solutions for every behavior problem imaginable. It is easy to read that will turn you into the ""adoring master"" your pet yearns for. Why? Because it teaches you how to interpret your dog's feelings, by understanding his or her verbal and non-verbal cues. Once you understand the pattern you can establish the rules of behaviors that are acceptable and those which are not. I would classify this book as the ""bible of behavior"" when it comes to communicating with ""our four legged best friend"". It certainly holds a prominent place on my book shelf"
1,DogSpeak,This is a great book. I borrowed it from the public library and it was so helpful I wanted my own copy. It came in excellent condition.
1,Two of my favorite subjects,"I'm a long-time lover of mysteries ... and I'm a serious quilter. What's not to love? In addition, I was surprised to learn, after I bought this book, that it is set in a fictional Kansas town. And, I'm a displaced (to Colorado) Jayhawk. I want to live in this town, murders or no."
1,One of the best sources on Bonny & Read,"I bought *THE PIRATE TRIAL OF ANNE BONNY & MARY READ* in order to write a paper about these women for my Western Civ class. Out of the four books I read about pirates, *THIS* book provided me much more information on these women, by far. It's not large, so it's very easy to read - and provides straightforward, well researched facts in a no nonsense writing style. I found information in this book that I'd never read anywhere else, and the complete transcript of their trial was extremely helpful to me, because it saved me the time and trouble of ordering a copy. Ms. Tamara Eastman states at the end of this book that she is coming out with another book on Anne Bonny and Mary Read very soon. I am anxiously awaiting the next book, because I really enjoyed *THIS* one.Stephanie C. Cambridge, Massachusetts"
1,Decent Two-Fer at a Good Price!,"Quite a good 2 Disc set with 2 BJ documentaries included, neither of which I'd seen before, so I'm pretty pleased with this purchase.The first film covers the early days of Jovi, and the seond the post 2000 period."
1,Good Easy Read,I like Sue Grafton's books and I have read most of them. A real easy read but sometimes a little too much of the same.
1,P is for Pretty Damn Good,"I'm enjoying P is for Peril. In addition, it has survived my mother's scruitny and she has been following the series since A is for Alibi. I like action, good dialogue, local honey, and I like P is Peril. Those who don't, can, as George M. Cohan said, stick antz in their Japantz. -- Andrew McAleer is the author of Appearance of Counsel and the executive editor of the Rex Stout Journal."
1,Amazon Reviewer is confused,"Did you notice that the Amazon reviewer thinks that previous books were set in the '90's, in other words, later than this one? NO,NO. Any serious Sue Grafton reader knows that A-P are IN ORDER, and that Kinsey has not made it to the 90's YET. I can't take a reviewer seriously who doesn't know that about the series.I thought that this was better than O, but not one of the great ones. I agree that the secondary plot was actually more interesting, and with the reviewer who discerned the relatively subtle solution/reason for the crime.I hate to wait another year, too. But at least we have ten more to look forward to."
1,Sue Grafton Does It With Again With P,"Sue Grafton learned the alphabet well, and she also writes terrific mysteries. With P IS FOR PERIL, Ms. Grafton takes some chances. While the book seems on the surface to be a typical Kinsey Millhone story, Sue Grafton writes this book in peril. She tells a solid story about Kinsey being hired by a doctor's ex-wife, recommended to her by a long-ago client to find a missing person, the prominent doctor who has vanished without a trace. The story also involves a potentially dangerous near-romance for Kinsey, but Ms. Grafton's greatest risk of peril comes with her final plot twist. P IS FOR PERIL is an amazing mystery and that final twist is impressive."
1,Kinsey works on two cases at once,"Kinsey Millhone is hired to investigate the disappearance of nursing home executive Dr. Dowan Purcell by his ex-wife Fiona. He is married to a woman named Crystal at the time of his disappearance. Kinsey investigates several motives, including some shady financial dealings at his work and an unhappy marriage. A second plot revolves around Kinsey's plans to rent office space from two brothers, who are hiding a grisly secret. The search for Dr. Purcell occupies most of the book, and Kinsey finds a lot of dead ends as she investigates his family and business connections. The relationship with the two brothers is more suspenseful but that subplot ends in a rather [bad] and unsatisfying manner. The solution to the disappearance of Dr. Purcell moves very slowly until the end, when Kinsey has a sudden revelation, seemingly something she had not considered during her investigation. Though not the best book of the series, this one is still a good read."
1,Aren't you being a bit hard on Ms. Grafton?,"I agree with most of the critisms others have posted about P is for Peril(the ending is vague, I'm not sure of the killer's motives,the book is padded with endless desciptions of rooms, and Kinsey seemed to discover clues as if she were pyshic) However, this book is not as bad as they would have you believe. The subplot with the Hevenger brothers is the more exiting and menacing part of the book. Fiona is a great character. (She should have been in it more) I laughed out loud when Kinsey was hiding under the desk in the nursing home. While I agree it is not the best in the series, I will still be buying Ms. Grafton's next novel in hardcover. Respectfully Submitted Don"
1,Another Winner,"Sue Grafton's series is my favorite addiction! Her stories are exciting and her characters are very real. It's evident she is an observant people watcher.Because I love her series so much, I decided to start one of my own. Under False Pretense is the first and I am presently working on my second book. I can understand why Sue enjoys Kinsey so much. You get to know so much about the characters they become a part of you. I love spending time with Samantha Parker as much as the many hours I've spent and continue to spend with Kinsey. I'll miss her after Z.Maria Pease"
1,One of Grafton's Best!,"I have listened to several of Grafton's works on audio. I truley believe if youhave not tried this format your missing something. Most of the audio books arenarrated by Judy Kaye, who by the way is excellent. I enjoyed P Is For Peril andI don't understand why the reviews are not better. The ending was perfect.I suggest that all of the 287 people who have written reviews for this book, pleasetry the audio version. You will Love It!!!"
1,Another Good Letter...,"By now with the alphabet book, one knows the formula and either likes them or does not like them. Each one gives us more insight into Kinsey's character. In this one, there were several possibilities for the whodunit which kept me guessing. There is also a good subplot involving Kinsey renting office space. She gets a little more than she bargained for!"
1,Grafton is back in top form,"After a disappointing O is for Outlaw, Grafton writes another great chapter in the Kinsey Millhone saga. The story was thoroughly enjoyable, and included all the characters.The ending was different. This time, Kinsey does not ""sign off"" in a postscript chapter, and the last page was vague. In fact, I even compared my book with a new copy because I was convinced mine was missing a chapter. Aside from the unsatisifying ending, the book as a whole was excellent."
1,Great Reading,"I think P is for Peril is a very well-written book. It's a mystery and I haven't read that many mysteries lately, but I liked this one. The main plot is that Dr. Dowan Purcell has been missing after he left a nursing home. Instead of being hired by his current wife, Crystal, Kinsey Millhone is hired by Fiona, his ex, to find him. Then there is also the part about Tommy and his twin, and Kinsey finds out about their dark past.This is the first Kinsey Millhone mystery I have read, and I think she did a great job. Grafton gets you into a book and you just want to know what's going to happen next. Now that I have read this book, I think I will go and grab one of her earlier ones before reading Q."
1,P is for Peril,"I just finished reading Sue Graftons ""P is for peril"" and I enjoyed it very much. I have read all of Ms. Graftons books and look forward to a new book each year. I could hardly put ""P is for Peril"" down."
1,P is for Phenomenal,"I'm a huge fan of the Kinsey Millhone series, and P is my favorite since I and J. This book is a little longer than Grafton's norm, and it's really three mysteries rolled into one. The well-liked Dr. Dowan Purcell is missing, and we don't know whether he left town voluntarily, whether he committed suicide, or whether he was murdered. There is also an intriguing development with the two men who are leasing Kinsey her new office space. As always, Kinsey observes the world with her characteristic sense of humor. The characters are so well drawn, they leap off the pages. There is a surprise in almost every other chapter, the pace is breathtaking. Never before in a book has Kinsey been so wrong in her initial perceptions, but she perseveres and in the end, she figures it out--and the reader goes along for the ride. And I did love the subtle ending. Well, well, but of course, I said to myself...It is SWEET. Way to go, Sue. Can't wait for Q."
1,The Best Grafton Yet,"I can't imagine what I'm doing writing what appears to be the 255th review of this book. I mean, what more can I add? I feel compelled, though, because this one is superior.I've read each of the Sue Grafton books, A through P, (actually I've read Q, too) and I think this is the best one yet. The plot is extremely complex but also extremely clearly laid out. PI Kinsey Millhone makes her investigation without seeming to do much--clever lady. And further, she gets involved in TWO mysteries, one completely unintentionally. It will come as no surprise to you that she manages to sort it all out. As a retired physician, I was pleased that she tackled, among other things, the currently hot subject of Medicare fraud.I do find myself wondering, though, what Kinsey Millhone will do when she has reached Z. Maybe she'll start with primary numbers which, I'm told, are infinite. All the better for us.Scott Morrison"
1,Missing Ex,"Kinsey gets a call from Fiona. She is Dr. Purcell's ex-wife and is concerned that he has been missing for nine weeks. Fiona believes he ran-away from Crystal his present wife. Everyone has their own idea of what had happened to Dr. Purcell but no facts. Kinsey finds herself in danger but continues until the mystery is solved. You will like the intrigue of this book. By Ruth Thompson author of ""The Bluegrass Dream"""
1,MOB is the best book I've ever read.,"This book is great,it is what got me hooked on stories about the mob and mafia. I would recomend it to any one who is intrested in organized crime."
1,"Good product, good price","Arrived quickly, decent condition, works great. Just plug it in and go, didn't even have to install anything or set anything up. Finally, I can use my cd drive again! :)"
1,SO MUCH BETTER!!!!,"This time they pulled out all the stops, this is a non-stop thriller. If you are not on the edge of your seats in this one you have no fears at all my friends. It is bloody, brutal, and very sadistic, as it should be. It doesn't disappoint for a second. The only problem I have is that the characters sometimes are pretty annoying and you hope they die soon, but the movie is so good that you can look past it. All in all, this is destined to be a classic like the first one so pick it up. PEACE!"
1,Saw 2 rocks 6 days a week and twice on Sunday,"Thats right bible toting freaks, Saw 2 hits hard and rocks the casba. There is an increase in blood and gore, like the saying goes"" oh yes there will be blood"". There are more bodies, I mean actors in this version. I rate both movies pretty equally. Wahlberg is a pretty pi$$ed off cop/father who does a good job of busting ""jigsaws"" chops in this flick. The action and suspense of this film is very fast paced compared to the first film. With a wide range of traps and scenerios presented to the victims, this series is one of the great horror ones in years! This is a must buy, and forget renting movie. Remember in the 80's with all the slasher movies? After the first movie they all got really silly and tried too hard to be many things, instead of great horror. Saw is a franchise that should have some life in it for atleast the third installment, which is guaranteed at the end of Saw 2. 2 bloody thumbs up mate"
1,A pretty decent sequel,"If you liked Saw, I'm willing to bet that you'll like Saw 2 as well. Jigsaw's back, and some questions are answered, while new ones emerge. I think that the premise is very unrealistic compared than the first one, though. 2 guys chained in the bathroom, and people killed one by one in ""tests?"" Okay, I bought it. A whole bunch of people on a moniter is much harder to believe. But once you get into, it's pretty good. It sets you up for Saw 3, which is a better movie."
1,Awsome Movie,"To all the horror fanatics out there, this will be a classic. Normally the second movie in a series is not worth seeing but this one.....yessss!!"
1,"Good horror flick, but not as good as the original","It is a good thing that Saw II is not a carbon copy of Saw I, which is honestly what I was expecting to see.However, it was also not as good as the first movie, and is more of a traditional slasher-type film.Still, for those who enjoy horror movies I would recommend it, and this 4 of 5 stars I am giving it relate explicitly to how good it is compared to other horror flicks.For those who don't like horror, I don't recommend this movie, because it is not ground-breaking like the first one."
1,"Good, effective sequel",This is a good piece of horror with some great & gruesome traps in it. There are a quite a few very effective setpieces and some really twisted games involving some truly unpleasant characters. It's a worthy sequel and worth watching for any horror fan.Sherlock Holmes and the Flying Zombie Death Monkeys
1,Excellent Sequel,I think this was an excellent sequel to the great original saw classic. THey way they tie this movie in to the first is really good and once again the movie leaves you wondering? who will survive and how?
1,A decent horror film with a few good surprises..,"Saw 2 is a fairly good sequel, a serial killer called ""jigsaw"" kidnaps people an forces them to take a deadly test - usually involving cutting off a body part to survive.This time around jiggy kidnaps a bunch of people, including a police detective's son, and imprisons them in a death-trap rigged house. The detective tracks down jigsaw only to find out that, well , I won't spoil it. There are some good surprises in this movie, one that is very obvious, others that are pretty clever.One of the better horror films to come out in recent years."
1,Saw2,"Absolutely gripping, if you enjoyed Saw 1 you will love Saw 2, more suspense, more thrills, more jumping out of your seat and mind boggling, jigsaw get much more scene so you know who he is, but you sure dont know who you are dealing with and your in for a surprise, the storyline is gripping from start to finish, get ready for the best horror in a long time, the characters get much more than they bargained for too, this film seem to reach a climax you thought would never come, so get comfy and hold on to your seats, and you will never work out the ending its fantastic"
1,The Games Continue!!!,"This was a really good sequel! I like the S.W.A.T team scenes and the traps and twists! After bailing his son out, Detective Eric Matthews finds out where Jigsaw is hiding, but for Jigsaw, getting caught is part of the game. Eight people are trapped in a house. Included in the game are Amanda from the original, Eric's son; Daniel, Xavier, Obi, Gus, Laura, Addison, and Jonas. They all must find an antidote for the poison gas they are breathing. Later, Xavier chases Amanda and Daniel to the classic Saw bathroom. Eric is finally enraged by Jigsaw that he beats him up until he tells him where the house is. If you love horror, Saw, and twists, you'll love SAW 2!!!"
1,Saw series are great,"I have seen all the Saw movies. As a fan of scary, horror movies I rate these as 4 star. The suspense is great and they do not lag at any time. So sorry there won't be any more.A Fan"
1,Saw II,Good quality. Didnt want it to end. Video quality was good. No issues streaming. I really need to see the rest of the saw series.
1,A Horror Movie Legacy,"Not to bore w/ all the details that others have written, but can anyone see this as being one of the horror movies that has 7 sequels spun off of it. Hollywood has lost it's flare when it comes to horror flicks, but SAW is one of the films they got right this time. True, there wasn't enough blood and gore, but the suspense and plot compensated for the lack thereof. I'm sure we'll be seeing more of Jigsaw's protege in the future. If there's one lesson to be learned form this movie, it's that ""Patience is a virtue""."
1,Saw 2 - The way Saw1 should have been made - Great job!,"Bravo! - I really had several problems with Saw #1, but the film-makers seemed to learn from there mistakes and present a really well-paced film. With clever plotlines, insight more into the story of ""Jigsaw"", and longer clever death scenes.... EOC calls this one a winner. Great job! - kept me captivated till the end! - Extras on the DVD are also a great add on that explains the death scenes in detail(EyesofChaos dot com)"
1,Saw II,Saw 2 was a very good movie. If you enjoyed Saw then you will enjoy Saw 2. I thought that Saw 2 was better then the first one but the first one was still very good. I went to Saw 2 with a couple of friends one day and we all enjoyed it. Seeing it in theaters was awesome. It was a little bit loud. There is a heavy bass sound going on almost through the whole movie. I didn't get any sleep the night before going to Saw 2 from spending the night at a friends house and staying up all night. I thought I was going to end up falling asleep but I didn't because it was so good. I can't wait till this comes out on DVD I will definatly buy it the day it comes out! Very good movie. i recommend
1,Jigsaw's game,I want to play a game. That's the first line in this movie. It begins with a creepy scene and gets right to the point. Jigsaw is awesome.
1,"Yep, It's Good!","I was highly skeptical going into this film, but the tight plot, excellent writing and taut suspense completely won me over. If you liked the first Saw, or enjoy crime thrillers with a horror twist... you will like this film."
1,More gore than horror,"Being a big fan of the first Saw, I was very intrigued by the sequel. Knowing Hollywood style, I tried to keep my hopes from getting to high. This second movie had some interesting plot twists and clever ending, but failed to hit the homerun the first Saw did. They seemed more focused on getting the viewer to get sick or puke, rather than making them crap their pants out of terror. I still bought it and have no regrets about doing so, but would have liked to see a more scary horror movie. All in all, I would probably give it 3-1/2 stars, still a keeper if just for the torture devices they come up with. Very creative, but no match for the first one."
1,REMEMBER THE RULES !,"Darren Lynn Bousman's 'SAW II' is without a doubt one of the best sequel's in horror movie history! You can officially add 'SAW II' to the short line of excellent horror movie sequel's such as 'Halloween 2''Friday the 13th part 2''Evil Dead 2''Aliens' & ofcourse the more recent 'The Devil's Rejects' While not quite the masterpiece that part 1 is,it's pretty damn close & yes there is plenty of blood. The very beginning of this flick is disturbingly great!"
1,My Family,My Uncle Don was part of this family.....he is listed in this book that his mother Helen wrote. What a remarkable book.......what a remarkable family!!!! I am proud that this is part of my family heritage. Wouldn't be nice to know where the children are now.......after 40 years & what they have accomplished through such a unique family upbringing...........so progressive for the times!!!!!I always wonder what is the right way to have & raise a family that I would love a followup to this.
1,The Best Book I Have Ever Read,"I read this book for the first time when I was in 3rd grade and read it at least once every year after that through the 6th grade. I have not seen it for the past 30 years This book was the first book to really make an impression on me, and that impression has stayed with me to this day. After reading this book, I always thought I would adopt children when I ""grew up"". I can't wait to introduce my 10- and 8-year-old daughters to my favorite book of all time. I just recently got a copy from my local library, although I thought I would never see it again. You cannot imagine how happy I was to find it on your website. THANK YOU!! THANK YOU!! THANK YOU!!"
1,Tears to my eyes,"This book is one that I will always treasure. I would like to scream to every person,""Please read this book!"" I will never forget when my sister told me to read it.(I was going through a bad time) It has changed my life. I would like to meet one of the children or one of their children, but if you read the book you would know Helen would not be happy. P.S. try a harvest book store, that is how I got my copy."
1,excellent & still timely. why isn't it available?,"I have been looking for this book for years. I loaned my copy to someone and it was never returned. A pity because, I would like to share it with my stepchildren. I also located the Life article about the family, when I was in high school (25 years ago) at a local university library and found it excellent. Check the periodicals index from the year (listed in the book) that the Doss's were named family of the year. The story has always been inspirational, not just because of the love shown by the family towards each other, but because of the faith they showed in the face of seemingly insurmountable problems. Their faith in the rest of the world, to both help them, and eventually, accept them as they are, is an example we can all use."
1,Childhood memories,This book is imprinted on me from childhood---from this book I believed I learned some of my most important moral lessons. And snake meat. Will never forget the can of rattlesnake meat. I treasure memories of this book.
1,Dissapointed on family updates,"I love this book, having read it many times since I found an old copy at a library sale. Since my huband and I are in the process of adopting, I browsed Amazon on adoption and found the new edition of the book. I was thrilled to read the new copy would have an update on the family. I was disapointed when I received my copy to find just a few pages. So one of them became a computer programmer? I expected more. After all the time that has passed, the kids in the book are grandparents now. Helen has a perfect right not to divulge details, but the book shouldn't be billedas an update on the family."
1,My Inspiration,"Over five years ago, on a homeschool fieldtrip, I came across a pile of discarded library books. The pile was going to be taken to the recycling factory, the next day. An avid reader, my interest was not only in the amount of books sitting there in boxes, but also in the many old and worn looking books. Being told I could look through and take any books I wanted, I quickly picked up one called ""The Family Nobody Wanted"" by Helen Doss, and continued looking. On the way home I started reading the book and haven't put it down. Since that cloudy day over five years ago, I continue to read and enjoy the story of Helen Doss and her wonderful family. I am inspired over and over as she displays constant joy and patience in her children. I've always wanted a large family, and with her as my hero, I hope to one day be a mother to twelve children also!"
1,A loving and fulfilling true story.,I read this book as a teenager and I credit it as giving me the open mind and loving heart that I now have. I have been searching for a copy of this book to give to my own teenage daughter. I hope when I find it that her life will be enhanced by this book just as mine was.
1,OVERFLOWING WITH LOVE,"I never knew such love could exist until I read this book. I bought it as a child and read it many times. When I grew up and became a classroom teacher, I would read it to my class as literature. Every now and then, I had to stop reading to fight back the tears. One of my students must have fallen in love with it too because it disappeared one day. If you have a copy of this book, treasure it always."
1,An awesome book bursting with love,"I am 9 now and was 7 when I got The Family Nobody wanted. In those years, I must have read the book 10,000 times! I took it with me everywhere! The poor family expands to 14 people, twelve of them adopted kids. Sadly, my copy has fallen apart so that I can't read it. But if you can, read this book. It's worth it!"
1,The Family Nobody Wanted,What a wonderful book. I first read it in the 1960s. The story inspired me to adopt my son from Vietnam in 1973. Unfortunately I had my original copy stolen many years ago and never thought that I would be able to obtain another copy.THANKYOU Amazon.
1,"Brother MFC-5440CN Network Inkjet Printer, Scanner, Copier, and Fax","Very easy to use! Big enough to handle all the functions, yet compact enough to put almost anywhere. Well worth every penny and would recommend it as a ""smart buy""."
1,Works great,I've had it for a few months and I think it works great. There is a software update that even lets you configute it to scan and email without a computer. Just enter the email address or select it from the speed dial list and it will attach the document as a PDF.
1,Recognizing God in Each of Us,"BECOMING ME is a heart-warming picture book that tells the story of creation from a very special vantage point -- that of the Creator. I find myself drawn so fully into this story that I feel I am experiencing what it is like to be God, in a universe where ""nobody who knew that I was... but I was."" Vivid illustrations splash a riot of vibrant colors to express the way spirit finds form in the physical world, as the words transport me into the mind and very heart of God. The most precious gift of BECOMING ME is summed up best in its pages: ""Sometimes you realize that you are me."" This book has a message so priceless that I'll enjoy it with my daughters for years to come... and keep long after they've grown up and moved off on their own."
1,"Get real, people!",I can't believe the uberPC people posting here. The truth is that there ARE stupid people and people who do stupid things. Get over it.
1,Spiritual Gifts,Robert L. Thomas - I believe has communicated a clear contextual understanding of this subject. This book is well researched.
1,"Smooth, swinging bop","Mid-1950s session featuring the great Dexter Gordon on tenor, and Lou Levy on piano. Strong bop flavor, with a bit of west coast cool overtone. Worth checking out, particularly for Dexter's performance."
1,A true classic recording,"This is a great example of West Coast Jazz of the 1950's with an East Coast flare. The rhythm section is impeccable, a perfect groove provided by leader of the session Stan Levy on drums, tasteful comping and soloing by pianist Lou Levy anchored by the huge sound of bassist Leroy Vinegar. The horn line is in rare form with Conte Condoli on trumpet, Frank Rosolino trombone and long tall Dexter Gordon on tenor sax. My personal favorites- Monk's ""Ruby My Dear"", a perfect framework for Condoli's warm trumpet sound and ""Stanley The Steamer"", a cookin' blues feature of chorus after chorus of hot steamin' tenor sax by Dexter. Rosolino shines through out. The charts are a perfect blend of West Coast Cool and East Coast Heat. I first heard this album as a young man in the 1950's and lost track of it until the 90's. It has held up very well over the years. Great recorded quality, a warm to hot mix of some great classic jazz. Originally on Bethlehem records. Very cool cover art."
1,Nice session,"This is the 2nd of three recordings Levey did for Bethlehem. The front line is terrific with the rare inclusion of Dexter Gordon playing on the west coast. Nice arrangements, swinging band - one of my favorites."
1,Let's Dance!,"I purchased this disc on a pure whim. Unlike my friend who was irish, this band is from England. However, there are several similarities. Both are well packaged, spirited, somewhat funky, and know how to get a groove on. while I am not fond of rap, I found the addition of MC DET to be a nice touch. With the exception of the first track, his rap is more subdued and he isn't rapping about murder, rape or other acts of violence. If there's a downside its the inclusion and possible over use of electronics which, at times, sounds a little dated. Buy it and dance the night away."
1,A Beginning or fin du siècle?,"If I had the time and resources to make a film, Making Bones would be its soundtrack. Listening to this album and you find yourself within the inner ear of an encyclopedia of inspiration-its sources and results. Making Bones is jazzed up with improvised and inherent energy and yet so undertoned and nuanced by the gods of chill that you can listen to it while waking or sleeping. It is a bellicose album for the passive, the peaceful search for meaning in chaos and deconstruction. Amongst the sounds of bass, guitar, horns, drugs and the minimalist use of samples, these label-dodgers, artful in their undertaking, reproduce the sound of electronic music on live instruments and take the listener past so many different styles-- so many stories-- the majority of which are pure instrumental.You never miss a voice.I'd opt for this as a soundtrack, my choice for an album for the next century."
1,"This is ""our songs""","Nigh fifteen years ago, Barbara and I married. This album played a role in the marriage of the ""impossible couple."" Get it and savor."
1,best-ever collection of autumn songs,"I bought this on a whim years ago and it has become one of my top ten all time favorite CDs. This CD has artists I had never previously heard of, like John Gorka and Cliff Eberhardt, but whose music I now happily own. I can't wait for autumn every year so I can break this music out again. Five stars!"
1,Delightful book - recommended for all Rotarians!,"A delightful book, fun to read - and if solving the crime depends on a piece of information that isn't shared with the reader (therefore just 4 stars), at least the protagonist doesn't discover it either until near the end of the book.The characters are delightful, as is the book's commentary on Rotary and Rotarians (beginning with reactions to the impending visit of the District Governor in the opening chapters). Now that I've finished reading it, I intend to start it circulating among the members of my own Rotary club."
1,Green Mansions,"a highly mystical book, parallel with the rise of existentialism in Europe, it is a real portrait of the temperature of europe at that time. an anti-romance unlike most, it deals more with the soul than the heart, bringing to light the animal and spiritual in the hero's evolution from youth to man. all set against the unrivaled beauty of the Amazon. very interesting book."
1,**educational and entertaining**,"De Grandis is a great author I have several books from her.She has a very blunt writing style, which i have come t enjoy and you will too.:)"
1,Interesting Insights,"Vicki Noble's Motherpeace Tarot is the best interpretation of the Tarot I have ever explored. The art work of the cards is excellent, as well.John Cutler Anderson, nickname of Lucky given at birth"
1,Indescribable,"Lots o fairly nice stuff on this album, sorta interesting mix of folk/industrial noise with religious overtones. What makes the album for me, though, is the one track ""Dies Irae"", 8 minutes+ long, and indescribably beautiful and haunting. If you can find the album, buy it. I lost my copy in a fire five years ago and am still looking for a replacement"
1,Quick Easy Great Read,"I'm sorry if I don't have a lot to say but I think reviews sometimes give away too much information (like reading the back of a dvd and learning too much before seeing the movie) I also have noticed that many ""critics"" complain a lot ;)I loved this book. It was more than I expected and seemed thorough. I was up late reading it into the wee hours of the morning and fascinated with details I never knew.I also had NO idea just how much she helped her husband in his politics. She was amazing.Enjoy this book, why not? ;)"
1,"I BEG TO DIFFER, BUT......","For those of you who are whining about the credibility of this movie, this film was based on a TRUE story. I have only two things to say to those of you who have negatively critiqued this film based upon your own ignorance: When was the last time you were in a hot zone with enemy fire buzzing your Jose Eber knockoff haircut? -and- 15 MINUTES!"
1,Service Rules,"I commend the men of the Marine Corp.This movie goes into detail of a ""coverup"" and an honorable man is trashed but proven innicent by jury of his piers."
1,Tommy Lee Jones,"Wonderful, wonderful movie. Especially the friendship between Jones' & Jackson's characters, Hodges & Childers."
1,Almost Prophetic,Seemed a bit farfetched when it first came out in 2000 but with Ambassadors being killed and embassies in Yemen and Egypt being stormed it's now extremely current and definitely a cautionary tale in our increasingly complex world.
1,RULES OF ENGAGMENT,"ONLY ONE THING TO SAY,AND THAT IS,THIS FILM IS ONE HELL OF A GREAT FILM,MISS THIS ONE YOU MUST BE MAD."
1,Poor Ending,"Great acting, particularly by Jones. Could the government really do this to one of their finest? Absolutely. I don't have any problems with the movie until the ending. Good story line, suspense, lots of action, then it was if the director ran out of film and couldn't finish the movie and had to settle for a few sentences across the screen. How the coverup came unraveled was an important part of the story and needed more detail. I have the same feeling I get when CBS does a special news bulletin for 20 minutes followed by all the missed commercials then we rejoin a show and try to make sense of the story line."
1,There are soldiers and then there are Marines,"Rules Of Engagement was one of the best movies of the year. Aside from the movies A+ sound and effects, it also showed the strugle the men and women who protect this country are sometimes faced with for doing what they Have to do. While most military men and women will never face situations nearly as serious as this one, it defenitly shows the down side to too much politics in the military. This movie also shows the elite brotherhood that is shared in the Marine Corps, its like they say in the Corps, ""there are soldies, and then there are Marines."" If your into War Movies, Action movies, or you like a good drama this movie is for you, see it once, see it twice, then see it again, you'll never growe board of this classic film."
1,Sam & Tommy Lee rocked this movie!!,This product was in pristine condition. The packaging was professionally wrapped and the shipping was super fast. I will definitely continue to purchase through Amazon and its recommended sellers.
1,Must see movie,"If you have ever wondered what our soldiers have to do, to do their jobs and who they have to offend to get it right; this is a must see movie. When you are at war, some say you must follow rules, but when should those rules be broken or who determines if they were broken at all?"
1,From a Marine's Standpoint,"I actually thought that the movie was pretty good. I did enjoy every minute of it. But since I am in the Marines, it kind of made me mad because of the fact that there has been incedences like the case in the movie. Where the government throws all responsibilities and allegations at one man to save their own hide. The suspense was outstanding. I really don't see what made some of the other veiwers not like it. Take it from me. The movie was couldn't have been better unless they showed that congressman getting beat down."
1,"A great movie, especially now!","Watching this movie, in light of the recent terrorist attacks, makes you wonder if this could really happen if we inadvertantly kill some afghanis or pakistanis in our war againt the taliban. Will we come down our own military leaders as they do on Samuel L Jackson? Who would prosecute? This movie raises those questions, and people who watch this movie again after 09/11 will see it in a different light, thats for sure. And if you haven't seen this movie, It is a MUST! The commentary is good too."
1,Better Than A Few Good Men,"Great teaming of two of the finest actors today. Excellent action sequences combined with dramatic courtroom scenes. What more could anyone ask. This film also boasts good supporting cast. There is a good lesson here, also, about Marines under fire and doing what is necessary to accomplish the mission. I hope our government saw this and understands that successful missions depend on our men and women in uniform doing their job without any suit-wearing bueracrats telling them whats-what!"
1,Great War Drama,"I am so angry that I had to wait until Sunday to see this movie because my mom had a headache and dragged me into Return to Me, which bored me more, and I'm only 13, so everypme has a right to be surprised I understood and liked this. It has great camera looking, and a deep, rich storyline, in which Samuel L. Jackson and Tommy Lee Jones fight the courts about the murders of nearly 90 Iraqis. Highly recommended.* * * * (out of * * * *)"
1,a tommy masterpiece,"If you loved a few god men & tommy lee jones , then this is a five star for you.. ENJOY !!!!!"
1,Great story with great acting,Rules of Engagement was one of those movies where I didn't need to know what it was about to rent it. All that I knew was that Tommy Lee Jones and Samuel L. Jackson were in it. That is all I needed. I knew that the movie was going to at least be good but it turned out to be fantastic. The whole plot itself is wonderfully constructed and written. It had you thinking the whole way through. The war sequences were awesome also. I haven't seen this good of war scenes since Saving Private Ryan. These two match up very well. The court room scenes were wonderfully done and very suspenseful. I thought the whole movie was edge-of-your-seat kind of action. And the acting was superb. Of course that is what you expect out of those two. All in all Rules of Engagement is a highly above average movie for it's genre and it greatly recommended from me. 5 Stars
1,A very intriging movie - not a reference source for the band,"I'm an Oliver Stone fan and a Doors fan so maybe I'm a little biased, but I thought 'The Doors' was an extremely entertaining movie. It wasn't Stone's best picture, but it deserves 4 stars for Val Kilmer's performance alone (I feel he should have been nominated for an Academy Award). I have no idea what Morrison was like in reality, but the man I've always imagined him to be was captured to a tee in Kilmer's excellent portrayal. Warning to biography hounds... this is a movie, and a pretty fun one to watch at that, but its not a documenary. You shouldn't view this movie if you're expectations are set on finding factual information. The truth is, only Morrison knew what was really going on in his head. But if you're wanting to check out an entertaining interpretation of the truth, give 'The Doors' a try; it might expand your mind!!"
1,Must own DVD!,"Although the DVD sounds great and looks great and there's still morons who just don't get how necessary widescreen is, I think this DVD was meant to be.The only think I didn't like about this film is that we really only get to see about 30% of what Jim Morrison's personality was like, we never really learn a lot from this film. All we see is a man obsessed with drugs who ocasionally sings. And not the great friend he was to the rest of the Doors or the amazing poet he turned out to be."
1,Good....But Not Great...,"It's a very watchable movie, but tells little about what made Jim Morrison tick. Scenes where whe are supposed to get an idea of where Jim got his inspiration are VERY vaugue. Also (not to say Jim wasn't interesting enough for a film to focus on him - he was.) It hardly tells anything at all about the rest of the band. I have to admit, I did not know much about this band before seeing The Doors. But the soudtrack and concert scenes were MORE than enough to cinvince me to check out their music and get me hooked! ....A good flick, but I doubt it's any more then semi-ficticious at the least"
1,"Script Bad, Actor Good","The script to Oliver Stone's The Doors may not have been great, but V. Kilmer did a good job as Jim Morrison. I am a fan of Jim Morrison's writing and the Doors' music, and I think VK took Morrison on, body and spirit. A few moments in the film, in particular, are extraordinary, where his resemblance to/embodiment of Jim Morrison is uncanny... (*If you saw the movie and you're a Doors' fan, you can't have missed that.)I agree that the soundtrack was fantastic, however maintain that Val Kilmer was the right one to play Morrison. In fact, I read that Val Kilmer was recorded singing along with Jim Morrison's voice on the last song in the film. For those who feel he was the wrong choice, go back and listen to how well he did that. I am a singer and I know what kind of work it takes to do something like that. It's hard enough to match your own voice, let alone someone else's. Credit where it's due. END"
1,a must watch for everyone born under the sun,"If there is any thing bad about this movie is that it does not go on forever and ever.The life of Jim Morrison is one story that can never be portrayed in words or pictures but this effort is worth a praise.Though it does not really shows what a good company Jim was but it do keeps you goin through the worst parts of life.If you really wanna see why this man was and still is a mystery,You must watch this movie."
1,*Groovy Movie*,"I'll keep my review short and simple. This is one of my top 5 all time favorite movies. Val Kilmer should have won an Oscar for his performance, or at least received more praise. Oliver Stone knows that his story isn't 100% true and he never claimed it to be. This was his vision of The Doors, and with the help of Robbie Kreiger, Patricia Kennealy, Pamela Courson-Morrison's parents and John Densmore, he did an incredible job. However, Meg Ryan wasn't all that. She's a decent actress, but not worthy/cool enough to play Pamela Morrison. When the movie came out, Meg talked about how over-rated she thinks The Doors(the band) are and that Jim Mrrison was just a drunk. Well, Meg, why associate yourself with the movie then? Anyway, the movie is an amazing experience."
1,The Doors (Special Edition),"Looks brand new, not a scratch on the DVD. One of my favorite movies so it was totally worth the $3!!!"
1,The Arrow Flies and Falls,"Being a huge Doors fan it was entertaining. Oliver Stone did a great job with the scene feel. Val Kilmer did a phenomonal job as Jim, even satisfactorily vocaling some of the live concerts. If you have read some of the books about Jim, ie. No One Here Gets Out Alive, you have noticed they did not show the artist side of him as he was in real life. They show more of the depression and self destruction. Also, Patricia Keneley was two people combined into one character. Even so this is a great film of the rise and fall of James Douglas Morrison."
1,Kilmer is Morrison,"Kilmer is Morrison in this movie, he acts and feels out what the man did and how he saw the way he did. This is a big winner and I like The Doors myself and this was a good one. Hooray for Oliver Stone for making this awsome movie. Long live Morrison"
1,Great Movie!,"I think this is a great movie and Val Kilmer did an AMAZING job, the way he was able to change himself through this movie from a younger jim, to an older one, was unreal. Meg Ryan also great in this. The music, acting, the story was very entertaining, this is certainly one of my favorite movies of all time.Great Job Kilmer!"
1,a mystical shine to the film,"The life of misunderstood rock star/poet Jim Morrison is delivered through a hazy 1960's filter and the remaining Doors given the sketchiest of treatment. A movie worth seeing if only to hear the timeless music and feel traces of the the free tumultuous time. Though little insight is given into Morrison (he is lightly shaded as an obnoxious drunk, musing poet, charming wit and lost soul) there is a mystical shine to the film. Val Kilmer is an astonishing doppelganger of Morrison."
1,Head Trip,"This was a good show in all. Very Trippy!! Anyone notice that Billy Idol appeared in it?? heehee! Billy played ""Kat"". He had brown long hair and was on crutches. He was briefly at the bar. Be careful... if you blink, you'll miss him!! :o)"
1,A visual and aural feast...,"This movie is driven by the psychedelic music of the Doors. In many of the concert scenes, the music is visually translated into colors and motion. The movie itself is more about Jim Morrison himself than the Doors however. When broadly displayed like this, Morrison's contempt for the order of society is obvious. Val Kilmer should've been given better parts after this movie because his performance is the best of his film career."
1,Superb!,"oliver stobe makes yet another masterpiece. val kilmer is an excellent actor, and this role just defies it further. for a 2 hour film, this is an excellent portryal for jim morrison. great!"
1,"some couldn't understand him, that's why they hated him.","Morrison new more about the world than we thought. I say go to ---- to all the people who said that he was a bad influence to our community, or people who fought againsted him. I wasn't around at that time so I cant say if the movie was close to the real life of thoes times or not but it was a good movie. 420 420 420 420 420 420 420 420"
1,best depiction of 60s and rock n roll,you love oliver stone or hate 'em but for this viewer The Doors defines rock music in the 60s better than any other movie. it's a stone trademark to get career-defining performances from people and in this case Val Kilmer gives one of the best performances of his career. Kilmer's transformation into Jim Morrison is uncanny. The music is used artfully and the editing is fantastic. The only false note is the casting of meg ryan as Morrison's wife. Otherwise a beautiful immersive movie.
1,"Good Val Kilmer, distorted history","I found this entertaining and Kilmer plays a pretty good Morrison. That said, the film twists and fabricates the truth in a lot of ways which is what happens whenever Hollyweird makes a film that a lot of us were there to wittiness. I saw the Doors at Whiskey and it was nothing like it was portrayed. I was at the Golden Gate Park gig as well, also a complete fabrication. The genius of Morrison boosted by the rest of the band is hard to capture but we have the music to remind us. I am going to see Ray in a club venue in a few weeks and it will be interesting to hear him play again. I was a lucky boy to grow up only 70 miles from the City and our rescue from the sticks was to go and see music. It was a great time to be alive but Morrison's star went through the sky too fast. I always wondered what the album after L.A. Woman would have been like. It is entertainment and bad history. Nuff said."
1,excellent evocation of 60s aspiration and excess,"For those of us who grew up in the 1960s, this is a wonderful film. It genuinely evokes the sense of newness and possibility of that time, that all old forms could be swept away, that we could live love and rock and not worry about the future. Of course we were wrong, and those who embodied all the hope and excess, like Morrison, paid the price with their lives - they were drunk, drugged out, and many eventually died of it.Looking back on it, I feel amazed at how naive we were, how arrogant, but then, we were children and youths, affluent and feeling that the possibilities literally were limitless. This film accurately portrays that feeling, both in its pathetic over-reaching, but also a lot of the beauty of it.This is the best Stone film by far, and I wasn't even into the Doors.Warmly recommended."
1,A Life of its own.,"Brilliant. The film starts out with The Doors, and then takes on a life of its own, becoming a cult object in the process, an objet d'art, breathless, entwined, twirling, obsessive, relentless, varicoloured...It's like a sex act that feels unbearibly good and creates expectations of a final, musical, passionate, finale."
1,Delicious and healthy - a great combination,"I initially bought this blueberry juice as a potential grape juice substitute. I wanted something a little less sweet and not at all like the overly concentrated grape juice sold in stores. This juice certainly lived up to my expectations. It's delicious, and I really appreciate the health benefits. The bottles all come very well packed in safe, sturdy packaging. I am very pleased with this company and product."
1,GREAT BAG,"This bag is great. Sturdy. Stylish. I love the quality. Works great as a purse, diaper bag, or carry-all. Highly recommend it!"
1,Great little bag,"awesome bag. I love Timbuk2. This is my 2nd bag, and I basically bought this one to have a smaller bag to use at different times when I don't want to lug my laptop around. It's made well and looks cool...what more could you want."
1,"Excellent bag, over 2 years of use and abuse and still going strong","Got a bag in June of 2007, use it for my gym gear and commute duties. Ride a motorcycle and the bag is great. I have a wide back and back packs don't work very well, this bag perfect. After two years of hauling stuff back and forth from work and the gym, it still looks great.Would most definitely buy another one if something happened to this one. But at this point, the bag still looks new, except for some marks on the liner."
1,Very Large,"WOW! This bag was large. It was actually so large that I had to send it back. I later got the medium sized bag, and so far, it's worked well for my uses."
1,Grand-mother common-sense wisdom,"This book is a breath of fresh air for parents that find raising children a challenging task. It provides a down-to-earth approach, as well as great advice and guidance on how to act in specific situations. I recommend this book for all parents raising children during each stage of development. Through this they can find parenthood to be a positive and wonderful experience, and practicing parental discipline in a manner which will give rise to receptivity in their children. This is much needed grandmother- common-sense wisdom.Jeffrey L. Fine, PhD, Psychologist: Author of: -""The Art of Conscious Parenting"""
1,Not too bad... Great for the $,The items arrived quickly and were very easy to install. Water does flow away from foundation. They do flip up but holding clips on the downspout would make it much more functional
1,First cordless I have had with good reception,"This is the first cordless phone I have had, where I have had no interference trouble. Other cordless phones I have tried in my apartment consistently disconnected me in mid-conversation. I hear great on this phone (I am hard of hearing) no matter where in the apartment I roam. I hear great on the terrace, which was impossible with other cordless phones I have had. The volume control is a great convenience. My only complaint with this cordless phone is it is somewhat pesky to clear the caller ID list. There are three steps involved. This is my only disappointment. As far as cordless phones go, this is definitely the best one I have had."
1,best one so far,"I've owned at least 7 cordless phones, one costing more that [$$], and this has been the best. Easy operation, good feel in the hand and on the ear and totally reliable. I wouldn't be replacing the one I've had for nearly three years but I'm losing custody of it in the divorce. I like the phone so much it's the first thing I'm replacing. That's how good it is."
1,Man is wolf to man,"One of director Otar Iosseliani's stronger films. The movie takes place during several periods of time in his native country of Georgia: in the Middle Ages, in the early 1900s, during the Stalinist period (the bulk of the movie) and in the chaos of the early 1990s. The same actors often play different characters at the different periods of time (for example, the guy playing the medieval king also plays a Stalinist henchman and a contemporary smuggler). The movie works through vignettes full of deadpan humor, and a common thread of all the stories seems to be the absurdity of life, the arrogance of power and man's inhumanity to man. Iosseliani even plays a couple of roles here, as a Stalinist torturer, and as a present day bumbling projectionist, in one of the film's most elaborate gags. Overall, a great movie, with Iosseliani's caustic humor telling us, as the old Latin saying, that man is a wolf to man."
1,Very funny,"Although not as good as his ""Twisted Tales from Shakespeare"" and ""The Classics Reclassified,"" this volume is still a funny overview of American History."
1,funniest book I have ever read,"I first read this book in 1963 and laughed and cackled aloud, on the bus, at home, at work...Best view of American History you will ever read."
1,It all started with Columbus,"Book - the service was outstanding. The book came in just the condition as described and it was carefully packaged. Inside was a very pleasant personal note and a bonus gift book! Overall, would give this supplier a big hand-shake for service and delivery."
1,Helpful and Hopeful,"In observing Carol's gifted writing skills, I find that she is also very caring as she shares in this book the stories of other persons having been (or still are) married to someone gay. Discovering this after one is married is traumatic (I know from experience), but thanks to books that have been penned by Carol and others, we are no longer alone. That helps, believe me! Thank you, Carol, for your time and energies spent on behalf of Straight Spouses."
1,Helped Me Through A Rough Time!,"Last year my husband of 25 years came to me and told me he was gay. He had been struggling with his orientation for many years and now finally knew who he was. I was shocked and struggled myself with this news. We have teenage boys and what to tell them. Well we didn't for 8 months until school was out. I also needed time to find out where to turn. I found Carol's website and then ordered her first book on Amazon. Finally, someone knew what I was going through. The stages that women face are pretty much the same. I read the book twice and then ordered the second book to start the recovery process. It has been over a year now and things are still rough but I still refer to her books and I am grateful for the section on telling your children. I feel very blessed to have found Carol's books and her blog has helped me through the tough days. I know time is the only thing that heals and I am far away from recovery but I am getting there."
1,"Light Jazz muzak was not what I expected, but still above average","I bought this about a year after I've been enjoying Focus III and like a fool, I expected more of Focus III. I go that in Father Back and Focus IV, but most of this album is light jazz and almost muzak? It's Focus so it's good muzak at least and classy as always."
1,"Style, comfort","I ordered the Mimosa sandal in 7E Camel. It is true to size and comfortable. I love the style, looks dressy even as a low heel. The footpad inside is man-made material, but with stockings it is comfortable. Too bad the footpad isn't microfiber or something like that."
1,My Favorite summer go-to-shoe!,"I know these shoes are made of non-leather materials and usually would not even have tried them because of that. But, once on, they are the most moldable, soft, well fitting and supportive sandals I have. I have a complaint about the black rubber sole and stacked heel - the rubber is too soft and the back of the heel mars very easily. Another complaint is that they are so hard to find! I have several pairs and will keep looking..."
1,Lifestride Mimosa Sandles,I love these sandals and am unhappy that they are discontinued. If there are any out there in size 8 give me an email!
1,SO COMFORTABLE!,I bought these shoes to wear to a wedding....they were so comfortable I could have danced all night and nearly did!! Thank you!!
1,review by james,"I bought this book previously on my Kindle. This is an excellent book, thoroughly well written with profound knowledge of the subject."
1,an all-time favorite,"I come back to this book again and again. Reading this book, or any by Emmet Fox, breathes new life into my world and I feel like a whole new person. So, so inspiring. Don't miss this one."
1,Good book!,"Bought this book after reading Louise Hay's book (I forgot what it was). This book is inspiring and helpful for those who believe in the power our thoughts,"
1,Clear and Understandable,"I first read this book about 20 years ago and reread it periodically. His writing is clear, understandable and a pleasure to read. It is a practical resource on how to live your life. All of Fox's books are uplifting gems and I recommend them highly."
1,best season of CSI,"This is my favorite season of CSI because of two great story lines. The first one involves the team's hunt for the elusive Miniature Killer, which ends in a truly gripping and haunting climax. The second one involves the introduction of a new CSI, Michael Keppler (played by Liev Schreiber). The Keppler story line has a great film noir feel that will delight fans of crime fiction."
1,CSI = Awesome,"Must have for any fan. Special features on the last DVD in the set gets better and better with every season, and this is no exception. See how the whole Miniature Killer story line came to be and the the making of the models. Plus, the commentaries with episodes are good show choices. As Greg would say, ""Sweet!"""
1,HUGE FAN OF CSI!!!!!!!!!,"I have been watching CSI since it started. I had to have the episodes with the Grissom/Sarah romance. I'm a hopeless romantic and I just love forensic shows. I learned so much from the show and had quite a few laughs. This show is so interesting and it keeps my attention throughout each episode. I favor certain seasons over others as you can see, but the show keeps getting better!"
1,"Still Great, but Too Much Darkness (Literally)","I first started watching CSI during the second season and promptly bought the first on DVD. I buy every season when it comes out. I agree that this show is still going strong into its 7th season. I'll be sad when this season ends in a few episodes as a result of a writers' strike that I fear will last several months.I only have two issues with CSI. This also applies to the others to some degree. (I love Miami and NY as well.) I'm tired of all the darkness. Any real police officer/CSI would turn on the lights before scrutinizing an indoor crime scene. That's why I deducted a star. I'd like a little more light on the subject.My other issue is that I think this DVD set is starting to push the limit on price. So glad that Amazon discounts so heavily. Best Buy wants $99! Usually they give a pretty good price the first week, but in this case they are asking more that list price."
1,Simply perfect,"This is one of the best albums I've ever bought. I orignally bought the album in 1988, and it didn't left my cars casetteplayer for months. It was also one of the fist albums I had to have on cd. And now its on my MP3, and still one of my top 10.Just listen to ""Loving you's a dirty job"", ""Holding out for a hero"", ""Ravishing"" and Freda Pynes ""Band of gold"", and you'll be hooked, for sure.Please Bonnie, team up with Jim Steinman again, and do the magic ones again."
1,Pretty good!,"They are not the best at what they do, they are the only one's who do it!Thank you Jerry!"
1,Sublime.,"Oh man, so many words could be writted. Those folks in Binghampton on 5/2/70 were so lucky - and I think they knew it at the time. The beginning acoustic set is heartfelt, and wonderful. The band obviously took it seriously (for them), and the crowd appreciated the generosity. The two electric discs that follow are 'typical' 1970 electric Dead. In other words - they will crush your skull, and you'll love every second of it! The only bummer is that the electric discs are Monophonic, not stereo. That may seem like a deal breaker - I assure you it's no problem. Just turn Viola Lee Blues up LOUD and enjoy... (We'll see you when you get back in a few light years!) Steve Urbauer Stephen Urbauer"
1,primo.,the first set is really great acoustic jams. i know you rider may be boardering on perfection.everything else is great. the electric set are really tight. solos are inspired and it is great to chill to. one of my fav. concerts EVER.
1,Second Disk is Great,"I'd heard a lot about this album, and so when i popped in the first disc, i was kind of dissappointed with the sloppy acoustic playing. Towards the end of the acoustic set, they start getting it together a little better. But the second disc is pure brilliance, a wonderful jam on St. Stephen, Cryptical envelopment, the other one, and cosmic Charlie. Unbelievably good, and yet, what could have made them not include all of st. stephen? it sounds like they cued up the tape right in the middle. I wish i had a tape of the original. All in all a good album, but there is better live dead out there."
1,"nostalgic memories and good time, grab some popcorn","I caught this documentary on PBS and happy to see it was available to purchase. This footage and information they have is very interesting and educational. Those of us who are fortunate to remember the drive ins will find this extremely nostalgic and fun. The next generation will find it very educational and probably feel jilted that they did not get to enjoy this great form of entertainment. I love how they show the history of how the drive in started and how this was a place to bring families in its heyday. I also loved how they showed ""new advances"" in sound systems, some of which were quite funny. It was great to see the ""stars"" of the drive in at it's heyday interviewed for this documentary, as well as the original movie trailers of drive in classics and as a special treat, there are concession stand ads there were used at the time of the drive in."
1,well worth it !,"What was the most intersting part for me was the history behind the drive ins.The commercials sprinkled in were nice, but it was the 'behind the scenes' news that I liked..."
1,Great night for Pac-man!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"This dvd is high Quality. Manny Pacquiao takes on the rugged Antonio Margareto in front of the packed Dallas Cowboys stadium. You can feel the electicity in this event as Pacquiao puts on one of his best performances against one of the biggest welterweights in history. You also get to see a classic back and forth struggle as Jaun Manuel Lopez takes on Rafeal Marquez. Then you get to see the great Julio Cesar Chavez in a great fight against Sammy Fuentas. Also the bright star Saul ""canelo"" Alverez fights former world welterweight champion Carlos Baldomir. This is one of better Dvds in the Grandes Peleas series. All fights are in english."
1,Great resource for new FLASHers who want to learn basics of XML.,"After playing around with Flash for the last three years, I finally began to get serious about scripting about four months ago. Like a lot of folks, I seem to lack that little something that separates a true scripting genius from a scripting hack. Although there's always hope, my mind simply does not work that way.Unlike many code books, this one made sense to me immediately. XML is starting to look like something I can actually begin to incorporate into my projects, thanks to Sas's easy-to-read style and clear explanations and samples. It may not be the first choice for XML and Actionscript gurus, but it should be a good investment for folks who want a good intro into the subject matter. Finally, Sas's ample coverage of generating XML with MS Office seems quite appropriate, since it is the dominant office suite (for good or ill)."
1,"Diva, plain simple.","Well some people call Christina Aguilera very discriminating names. But, are they just jelous of her capability to sing? Or are they just Britney Spears' fans to the very end? Who knows, one thing I do know is that this girl is going to make it to the top of the music industry. My favorite performance, by far on this DVD, in order are ""Falsas Esperasas"", ""All right now"", ""Climb Every Mountain"", and so on and so forth. With this DVD, you venture out of the old Sugar coated desolate pop songs. You dig deeper and experience songs you want to cherish for a long time. I reccomend this DVD for any Christina Fan, or someone looking for a singer with REAL talent!"
1,CHRISTINA HAS A BEAUTIFUL VOICE,"Christina is amazing. She has a beautiful voice. ELLE you might b right about hillary duff aleast shes trying, but Christina rocks you mightened see that but she does. HER WORDS TELL A STORY & TOUCH OUR HEARTS ! You just havent listened to her right ! I dont see you singing ELLE !CHRISTINA'S WORDS MEAN SOMETHING !"
1,BUY THIS DISC NOW!!!,"This disc is FANTASTIC. Buy it NOW. I can't say enough good things about this disc. The video quality is excellent and her voice is as spectacular as it is on her CDs. I've seen many of her live performances, and this one is certainly her BEST. This disc is a MUST for any Christina fan!!!"
1,Christina Aguilera scores hight with new DVD,"Christina Aguilera's new DVD, My Reflection, is one of the best out there right now. Captured live in concert wilt Brian McKnight, Lil Bow Wow, and Dr. John Christina shows why she is among the best female singers out there today. She sings 3 of her number one songs (Genie In A Bottle, What A Girl Wants, and Come On Over Baby (All I Want Is You)) and other songs from her #1 Album. This DVD also includes 4 music videos (3 of them Spanish). You will get your money's worth with this highley recommended DVD. So what are you waiting for??? Go ahead and order it!!!"
1,Stunning!,"Christina Aguilera is a great stage performer! Her voice is astonishing, she's a great dancer & she's very energetic.Unlike most of her pop contempararies, she puts on an overall good quality show. One thing I enjoy most about her concerts are her stage costumes, they are so freakin' cute! This one isn't as good as Stripped: Live in the UK, which I strongly recommend, but it's a great show & her vocal performance is top notch. It's very endearing to see her in her more innocent days & it shows you how far she's come from then to the woman she is today."
1,This review very helpful to me!,"Sorry for not speak English well. Christina Aguilera my favorite teen pop sensation! Not just a great model and good singer, she is also very emotional. When brother Jin Leung take me to see her show at amphitheatre, Christina almost make me cry with comedy skills and makeup. This DVD exactly like that show. Even in July Christina make me wish Christmas returns with ""Merry Christmas Baby"" with her father John Aguilera."
1,AND THE VIDEO DUET WITH............?,"......... THE VIDEO DUET WIH RICKY IS NOT ON THIS DVD! WHY?,IS IT THAT RICKY WILL PLACE IT ON HIS FORTHCOMING DVD CALLED ""EUROPA""?, I SUPPOSE THAT EH!, 'CAUSE IF NOT, I WOULDN'T BE THAT HAPPY WITH OF THEM!"
1,Thanks!,Would definitely buy from this seller again. Came very quickly and in condition that was stated. Thanks!
1,High Valley CD,"This was a great, hard-to-find CD of High Valley's early music. Enjoyable from a talented group."
1,Billie's Music Will Seep into You and Make You Cry,"Though the Billie Holiday record ""Body and Soul"" was actually recorded a few years earlier, it wasn't released until 1961. I'd heard her before, as she was a favorite of my dad's and I liked her music, but after sitting down and listening to ""Body and Soul"", I loved her, but sadly she'd been two years dead by the time I heard this record and learned how great she really was. ""Body and Soul"" was, in my opinion, one of, if not, Billie Holiday's best record and that's why it's on my list of one of the ten best records of 1960.All of the music from ""Body and Soul"" is included in this two CD set, though not in its original running order. Also included in this double CD set are the songs from the LPs ""All or Nothing at At All"" and ""Songs for Distingue Lovers"", so you're really getting your money's worth with this set. It's some of Billie's best."
1,fabulous late collection from Billie Holiday,"Love the sound on both of the CDs; the 2nd CD, which was released as the album Body and Soul, is really amazing - all of the sidemen including Sweets Edison and Ben Webster, do a great job of making the 2nd CD swing. My favorite tracks are Stars Fell on Alabama, One for my Baby, and Just Friends, although the best track for dancing is But Not For Me."
1,Among the funniest,"I count ""Consider the Lillies"" among the funniest books I've ever read. Some will consider the humor too juvenile, but then they probably never got Waugh senior, or Monty Python, for that matter. This book's place in my heart is close to all of Wodehouse and Amis's ""Lucky Jim,"" just down the hall from Boyd's ""Good Man in Africa"" and Italo Svevo's ""Confessions of Zeno,"" and within shouting distance of Flannery O'Connor's stories."
1,excellent product,"This helicopter was not as big as some other reviewers had mentioned but is a great toy. My son turned 5 and requested helicopters for his birthday, this toy fit the bill. The helicopter is a chinock style (not what is pictured below. The blades fold up nicely for storage and easily pop out and back in... which is great for my two boys. Only had the toy for about 1 month and the kids have definitely have played hard with it and nothinng has broken yet. :)"
1,A Good Introduction,"If the lives and administrations of the U.S. Presidents are an interest of yours, then this series of short biographies is for you. At right around 200 pages, the books in the series give a good introduction to the fascinating men that have held this office.I especially enjoyed reading the author's discussion of the disputed election of 1876, and how it was very similar to what happened in the election of 2000. Even down to the state of Florida being one of the contested states. But in the end, Hayes was the president even without carrying a majority of the popular vote.The books in this series give a great overview of the president and his administration. For some, this will be enough. But for others, there could be enough interest generated for them to read more indepth biographies.Highly recommended"
1,We're not in Hollywood anymore!,"What a quirky movie yet there was something compelling about it that made me keep watching. The perpetually overcast scenery and the not frigid but still chilly weather threw a blanket of menace over everything. As much as I hate watching movies with subtitles I couldn't get myself to stop watching. Even though I'd read the blurb about the movie on IFC I still kept waiting for a logical explanation for the main character's suffering OTHER than possession. I KNOW! What a Hollywood theme right? But the Germans made a very non-Hollywood film. It's quiet and understated. There aren't any bizarre special effects with blood spurting everywhere. Conversations are quiet, subdued even when the devil is speaking. LOL I have no idea if the actors are well known in Germany but none of them were even vaguely familiar looking to me which also added to the feeling of realness about this movie. The ending caught me off guard although it probably shouldn't have."
1,Amazon Price is too High,Lakewood pure 100% Pomegranate Juice is $9.99 at Whole Foods. Excellent Product . Amazon should be more competitive on the Price
1,Lost in translation,"Jelaludin Rumi is, as we all know a true poet of the heart.Although, when his passages were originally recorded in persian we must be reminded that our texts we now purchase in book stores have become hazy and sometimes unclear from the inter-language transformation.In this volume, Coleman Barks takes Nicholoson's translations from latin to english. Nicholoson translated Rumi's poetry into a more literal form. I suggest that in reading a volume of work translated to something as closely literal as possible to the original you will recieve more of a true insight to Rumi's thoughts.Another good source to defintly own by Rumi would be ""Open Secret : Versions of Rumi"""
1,what a talent,"I saw Iris a few months ago and she sang ""Our Town"" with just her voice and a guitar. It was amazing and it reminded me of just how good this CD really is. The final cut, ""Higher Ground"" had me of all people walking around the house singing as if I was in a church choir. Her voice twangs and fluctuates between notes effortlessly and is as smooth as cotton. It is a welcomed addition to the likes of Nanci Griffith and Emmylou. Open you heart to this CD."
1,Beautiful voice,Terrific CD- not as good as My Life but close. Our Town and Let the Mystery Be are two of her best songs. And I like that she ended a gospel hymn sung by her mother.
1,True Professionals ...,"This album was recorded quite a while ago, but for some reason I just found it. It's very good.It's a treat to hear Emmy Lou Harris do backup for Iris Dement in Mama's Opry, which is a sentimental song about Iris' mother. The REAL professionals, like Emmy Lou Harris, don't have to show off -- they know how to showcase the lead singer. And then in the next song Iris Dement sings backup for mom herself in a similarly professional manner. Her mom is not the same caliber singer, of course, but she is sincere and the whole thing is both heartwarming and ... truly professional."
1,"Yes, you can wear out CD's! Infamous Angel is one!","Infamous Angel will take your heart, mind and soul on a journey that you will want to repeat over and over again.Family, love, faith are so colorfully lyriced, with melodies, that allow you to drift off into a land of reality, that you did not know existed. Once you make this visit, you want to return over and over again.I have purchased 3 copies of this CD in the last 8 years. Actually wore out one copy. The others I lent out and I can not take the copy away from a friend. So, I just order a few more.Order two copies, one for you and one that you can lent to a friend!A must CD for anyone that is serious about what real music is all about!"
1,Favorite Album,I've owned a copy of this album for years. I just needed to replace my old copy. I love it.
1,good music.,"MY HUSBAND HAS OTHER TAPES BY IRIS DEMENT ALSO PURCHASED ON AMAZON.COM, HE LOVES THIS TYPE OF MUSIC AND WHEN HE IS SEARCHING FOR JUST THE RIGHT PLACE TO GO TO BUY, HE COMES TO AMAZON.COM, THE PRODUCTS ARE ALWAYS JUST WHAT HE WANTED, THANKS AMAZON!"
1,Terrific music,"This is a great album...wonderful band, great singer, authentic songs ...very 'real' music. We will look for her music again."
1,Astonishing,"""Our Town"" is, quite simply, one of the finest songs ever written. Sung with a voice that will pierce your heart, it chronicles the life of its narrator with such honesty and beauty it is hard to imagine anyone ever being the same after hearing it.The rest of the album, by comparison, is merely superb. Songs like ""Let The Mystery Be"" ""50 Miles of Elbow Room"" and ""Mama's Opry,"" just to name a few, prove that Dement is a major talent, and a voice of uncommon beauty."
1,Includes two of the best song performances of all time!,"If you've just done a philosophy course, then 'let the mystery be' pretty much contradicts everything you were taught! It's cute and carefree, I saw Iris sing it on the dazzling 'Transatlantic Sessions' BBC programme and she blasted my doors off! The album version is better still! 'Our Town' is an emotional tour-de-force! The rest of the album has songs which need a little more repeated listening to get the best out of them, but are well worth the effort. Not listenting to at least 'Our Town' is a serious crime against the quality of your existence, like failing to ever listen to Roy Buchanan's 'Sweet Dreams'."
1,Melodic and lyrical qualities of early Bob Dylan recaptured.,"I last saw Iris Dement in a small hall (a Unitarian church)outside Tampa, Florida. Sitting in the front row, perhaps 10 feet from her, I felt her beauty and directness that her albums only can suggest. She really has a unique voice, a religious gift, symbolized in ""Let the Mystery Be"" and connects me to early Dylan, maybe ""License to Kill"" in terms of power and melody."
1,iris's voice,"need i say more? this album is wonderful. our town, let the mystery be - two of the best songs ever written. and higher ground - LOVE it that her mother sings along. joyous."
1,Works great!,This sucker's been humming along beautifully for me for over 2 years now. I have not successfully over clocked with it though; but I blame the mother board for not performing it's end of the bargain.
1,Follow the Money!,"This book will help anyone who desires to learn how their box office ticket dollars are spent. The authors take you step by step through a standard profit participation agreement. I feel the authors are not as aggressive as they should be hollywood's unethical ""creative accounting"". The distributors and the audit firms would like artists to believe that the lack of knowledge is why many artist are ""cheated"" out of their net profits or as Eddie Murphy stated ""monkey profits"". All net profit participants should read this before they listen to their lawyers and auditors. Many auditors and attorneys are willing participants in the ""net profit scam""!"
1,A great book for parents who want to reconnect with their heritage.,"This is a practical book with inspirational and common sense look at raising any child but especially raising a native american child. It gives foundation and tips when there is no one else to guide you. I real pleasure to read. As an ICWA Director for a local tribe, I found the book as a clear look into the sensetivity of tradition and being part of your child's life forever. Beautifully written."
1,Of special value for Native American parents,"Keepers Of The Children: Native American Wisdom And Parenting by Laura M. Ramirez (whose husband is a Pascua Yaqui Native American recently inducted into the American Indian Hall of Fame for his successful career in baseball), is the first ""how to"" parenting book that draws upon Native American concepts and teaching stories to show just how to raise children to know themselves and their strengths, as well as creative for themselves productive and meaningful lives. Of special value for Native American parents, Keepers Of The Children is informed and informative reading that can confidently be recommended to the attention of any parent, regardless of ethnicity or racial background, wanting to instill enduring family values into the character and lives of their children in our multicultural world."
1,Kept My Daughter Happy,"It was summer, a special VB clinic and no knee pads(the other 4 pair had been stolen since the end of last season.) Quickly to Amazon and these arrived within two days and are still be used!!"
1,Good product,"I can't see why others have complained about this product. It is well made, easy to install and does the job. I could not find the seperate components for less money with free shipping, well worth a benjamin. For my installation, in the skirt of my 5th wheel trailer, there is a small problem, it is not totally waterproof at the rear, but then it was not designed to be installed in a wet location. A few big globs of Goop fixed the problem and I no longer have to cram the cord into a small box compartment. The instructions were confusing and almost illegible, but if you need instructions for a job like this, get someone else to do it. I would give it 5 stars if it had been waterproof."
1,"Very Durable, Adapter Plate Did Not Line Up","This kit was easy to install and so far is very durable. I like the standard Twist-Lock style plug. The ""Mouse Hole"" that it replaced on my trailer had a bolt hole pattern that did not match the adapter plate. Not a big deal, just drilled some new holes and it worked great, just wanted to let people know, I was caught off guard by it."
1,Could Have Been 5 Stars,"Sittin on Chrome by Master Ace is a diamond in the rough. I loved it when it came out and I still love it now. The style is Brooklyn Bass with an LA sound to it. When its done right it is hot and incredible sounding. Sittin on Chrome my top choice for tracks but there are others..INC RIDE, People in my Hood and Born to Roll are the some of the strongest..The only thing that keeps it from a 5 star album is the other rapper on the album. I dont even know his name or care to..the beats are all knockin though even the intro..Classic Unknown Material right here.."
1,hot album,Hot Album overlooked due to all that east-west ... that was goin' on.Hot tracks:U Cant Find MeINC RideThe B-SideSittin On Chrome
1,Very good CD with a few classics,"This CD has a few great songs on it, and the rest is mostly good. The INC Ride, Sittin on Chrome, Born to Roll, and many others are great tracks. Unfortunately someone jacked this CD from me a couple months ago but I'm probably gonna buy another copy soon. That's how good it is!"
1,solving the remaster pitch problems,"Brilliant album ,one of my favourites. Simple solution for the remaster problems : buy the japanese shm version. It doesnt have the pitch wow and flutter thing and just sounds FANTASTIC. Problem solved..."
1,Classic!,"I had this on cassette (for car and travel) and vinyl when it came out (about 30 years ago!). I loved it then and still do today. I got my version on compact disc quite a while before this current remastered version came out and I am very happy with it so I cannot comment on the one listed above. Granted, I suppose by today's standards, the songs on this album may sound dated but then again, so am I! I recently went to Curacao and Abaco for work (I wasn't a ""Bloody Tourist""!) and I was so glad I remembered to put this on my mp3 player for the trip. It fit in perfectly!"
1,Great stuff,"Anonymous Alcoholic is a wonderful song about being very thirsty and not being able to quit drinking. "" So I hit for the bar "". Lyrics that makes you want to listen. With a smile."
1,Much Better Than You Heard,"You probably have read in other places that this album just isn't very good. I strongly disagree. Though a bit fey sometimes, it is still filled with really catchy, really funny, really interesting music by 10cc. Not a ton of variety: I mean there is some, but not quite as much as you might be used to. Nevertheless, still a great album from the arguable best band of the 70's."
1,A must have for any Freehand 9 user!,This book is a must for anyone using Macromedia Freehand 9. The lessons in the book are great. They really help you learn the program quickly. After a couple lessons you are able to use the majority of the functions in the program and start creating you own works in a very short time.
1,Key to India the Indians sometimes seem to have lost ...,"A classical account on India - fresh, vivid, humorous, sometimes partially, but in many respects until this very day an excellent indtroduction in Indian thought and behaviour!What we didn't know until Sylvia Murrs detective-like analysis of manuscripts: the late Abbé (1766-1848) had a ghostwriter - he owned an older manuscript of the Ex-Jesuit Coeurdoux (+ 1691-1779), a brilliant scholar of Indian customs and lifelong observer of his exotic environment. Dubois added to his model many sociological and ethnical observations - a real teamwork ...The book is of outstanding interest - both authors lived in all more than 90 years in a continent whom they tried to understand - not in vain.This book represents in a certain sense the key to Indian manners and customs the Indians themselves sometimes seem to have lost ...* In 2002 there came out a German translation with commentary"
1,Quite Good,"This is the first novel that I have read by this author, and I have to say that it is pretty darn good!! The suspense in this book is plenty, and it really keeps you guessing what is going to happen next with the characters. I have found that I have become somewhat concerned for the characters in this book, this is how real the author makes it sound. Excellent book to read on those cold nights with the fire roaring."
1,Standard bird,"Some jazz ""purists"" would argue that the idea that Charlie Parker would ever play popular standards is tantamount to selling out. I would suggest otherwise. ""Bird"" added the same new, creative dimension to his recordings of standards as he did with anything else. Furthermore, in doing so, he introduced his music to a group which heretofore had never heard it and may have never unless they could hear some tunes that they actually had heard of. My only complaint about this CD is that most of the standards heard here are not the most well known of all time. But that isn't terribly important."
1,This film is it!,"I got a sneak peek of this film when it premiered out at Winter X-Games last year and man what a flick! It's all there, Summer X coverage, Winter X coverage, Prague, Spain, and a SICK Glamis section! There's even a funny Mini-50cc section that will leave you laughing yer arse off! It's loaded with ""extras"" too. Caleb Wyatt's first successful backflip, and some cool footage of the Militia boys practicing the backflip up at the Point X Camp. Highly Reccomended!!!"
1,Great Jazz Guitarist,"Jim Rainey is a great jazz guitarist. He influenced Wes Montgomery, Grant Green, and Kenny Burrell. This is a great CD (and I believe it is out of print). Well worth the purchase. If you enjoy jazz guitar, check out Jim Rainey!"
1,Great Labeler,"I can easily type any label on my PC, click Print, and the label automatically comes out of the Label Machine. This makes printing labels 100 times faster than poking a little keyboard. It also allows me to save any label and/or any template... QWERTY keyboard is much faster than Brother's PT-1400 Hand-held Labeler with alphabetical keys; the 1400 also errors out all the time which waste tape.I can set the margin really tight so it doesn't waste tape with wide margin's; however, the left margin is marked with two dots which I have to cut with scissors and the right margin is automatically cut by the labeler.The software that loads on my PC also has a lot of nice templates that could be useful for certain things.I keep it plugged in, on my desk, per 'Getting Things Done' by David Allen. It also takes batteries so I can take it with me..."
1,"Works as advertised, turns off too soon","After two weeks it's fast, reliable and I like the set of printing options. It shuts down too quickly during idle time even while plugged in and I haven't yet figured out how to change that."
1,"Great product, easy to use",I've used this label maker for several month now. It made organizing a cinch. I highly recommend this product. You can use batteries or even plug it in using an AC adaptor that comes with the unit.
1,Versitile,A great all around performer for labeling needs. Would like to see an option to upgrade it to a stand alone network printer. It is best to print a whole slew of labels at once to minimize cutting margin waste.
