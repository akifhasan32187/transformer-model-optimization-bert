0,I don't think so...,"This is, of course, based on the video game of the same name. It's about as much fun to watch as watching someone playing the game would be. You can regard yourself as having seen the whole movie once you're five minutes into it: appalling acting from all (although Lambert obviously has fun); dire lines; dreadful soundtrack; tediously fight scenes endlessly repeated substituting for a plot. There are some pretty cool special effects if you can stay awake long enough to notice them. No, if this puerile tosh ever gets mistaken for entertainment, you can take it as a sign than mankind has indeed been taken over by the demon dimension!"
0,nothing there,"this is something I pop in when I want to zone outthe only good thing about it is that it has christpoher lambert, and he is hot. that's it.no talent was required to make this movie. even christopher lambert could have been better."
0,Feedback on the book,"This book talks about Roald Dahl when he was young. He took part in the Second World War and this book deals with the time he went flying with the RAF in the war. Everyone dislikes going on wars but Roald Dahl enjoyed it. He thought that it was a free travel and it was interesting. He described all the interesting and exciting events happening to him. After three years of fighting and flying, due to the severe head injuries he had received when his Gladiator crashed in the Western Desert, he must on no account fly a fighter plane again and so went back home. I do not enjoy the story because I do not like wars. Wars are terrible and Roald Dahl described how he helped the others fight and how the others were shot and died. I felt upset when I read this book. I think this book is thick. The plot goes slowly and it makes the story boring."

0,I returned these shoes.,I did not like the look of the leather. It looked like cheap brown vinyl. They weren't very comfortable either. This was a disappointment since I've always been happy with Easy Spirit shoes in the past.
0,Way Too Narrow,"I have never seen shoes so narrow! I couldn't even get my foot in the shoe. So, if you have narrow feet, I would recommend to not order the narrow size but, instead, the next width size up.Also, as an extra heads up, if you do buy a pair of shoes from Peltz Shoes (where these were from) and need to return the shoes for a refund, make note that they will only refund you the cost of the shoe and not any of your shipping costs (cost to ship to you and cost to return the shoes). I gave this review a one star more for the seller as their refund policy for shipping costs (on the email sent to you from them) was unclear and the communication from them (when I questioned why no refund on the shipping costs) was terse."
0,Dissapointment,"I have worn Easy Sirit shoes and they had a perfect fit. This time, the same size, 6M did not fit, they were too tight.When I ordered my shoes, I looked inside my old shoes to find the size, I ordered the same size and was really dissapointed when they arrived.They looked beautiful, just what I was looking for, but not a good fit."
0,Disappointed,I was very disappointed in the look of this shoe. The brown crocodile material looked way too much like just plain cheap plastic for my tastes. The fit was as it should have been but I returned the shoes anyway.
0,worst shoe i have EVER bought not comfortable!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,i want to return these WORST shoe i have ever bought!!!!! i only wore once !!!! and will not wear again
0,sized incorect,"always wear 9 1/2 Med, these shoes were almost two sizes larger, I seem to have this problem often with Easy Spirit lately."
0,motion sport lace up by easy spirit,Runs short and narrow for me. I ordered 9 b. Felt like it would be comfy if it fit.http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000F5SLO2/ref=cm_cr_rev_prod_title
0,"""Dressy Lace-up""","Be aware that this shoe--in a WIDE- is not really WIDE ENOUGH to be called a Wide. The shoe runs narrow. However,it does come in an Extra Wide. Although the shoe has little to no arch support,it is, nevertheless a ""dressy"" alternative to gym shoes if you have problem feet."
0,Wide is not wide,"Was looking for a an all around slim black lace up shoe to take when traveling for walking, exercise, etc. I have wide feet and ordered this one in the D, unfortunately it felt more like an A or B - not even close to being wide enough. Liked the look but it's not for me."
0,Shoe Disappointment,"I wore this style shoe for many years and loved them. Now the D width is too tight, especially on my left foot. The shoes will be returned."
0,Better make sure the shoe fits!,"Well, the size 6D is more of a C and if you need a D this is a big issue. My mother could not wear these shoes. On top of that, it costs $12.50 to mail them back, and if you want to exchange them, the company (Heart and Sole Shoes) charges $8 for this. My mothers needs new shoes, though, and so I sent it. As of this dates it is 21 days since I placed the order. Today, I got the $8 money order back in an envelope with no message no nothing, just a hand-scrawled ""N.A. Refund"" next to my request for a refund. Well, okay, I'll take a refund then, and write off the hassle and the return cost. BUT WHERE IS THE REFUND?!?!? It's ordering by the Internet, and so this should be easy to do. What a lousy experience. I'll never buy shoes off of Amazon again."
0,Defective copy....,The seller was great and I had no issues with them. The book itself is apparently a defective edition. I checked with others and all the images are missing starting after page 202. Not good.
0,Boo Hoo,I bought this cd because I Am fan of fifteen even though some of the lyrics are kind of whinny hippy crap.However this one just goes to far the song white pride almost made me puke.I threw my copy in the garbage so no one would have to here it.
0,Ignorance prevails,I've attempted to get Amazon to change this as well as to contact the publisher. Thomas Jefferson had NOTHING to do with the writing of the Constitution of the United States. It was written by the Continental Congress primarily by James Madison and James Monroe while Jefferson was in France. Jefferson penned the Declaration of Independence...not the Constitution! I wouldn't care but for the continuing ignorance of the origins of our country being consistently on display here and elsewhere! Dear publisher...fix this!!!
0,"Okay, but troublesome 5-blades","This razor, in my opinion, is okay. Not great but not horrible. When it works the way I want to, the blades cut pretty well, and close. However, the main and largest problem is the 5-blade design. With the blades so close together, hair easily gets clogged between them, requiring more work to take out and clean. And clean you must, since it's hard to continue shaving when there's hair worsening the blades' gliding/cutting performance. As for the other users who love this razor, maybe its for some people and not for others (like me), or maybe my hair is too thick. Whatever the case, I recommend you to try this 5-blade razor out before you commit to buying the extra blades."
0,Excellent results -- if you have already shaved,"This razor ranks on par with single blade disposable bic shavers.It is positively awful. Right out of the box it caught my beard and felt like it had been used to strip varnish off the furniture. I thought it was something with the first one and tried a second. Same deal.I wondered if maybe I was doing something different so after trying it once and finding it unsuitable, I used a one week old, used several times, two blade generic disposable razor. It was far and away much better, much smoother shaving and less painful than this razor.I have tried this razor using gel, foam and shaving in the shower. Nothing can redeem it. Well.. one thing.I noticed that after I shaved with another razor, this razor glides over the skin quite smoothly."
0,bigguy,Love the razor but the price of the blades is hard to believe. Four blaeds for $17.00 they don't last any longer than any other blade. I had a $2.00 coupon & still couldn't get myself to buy them.
0,more blades more money,"Based on all the hype I decided to give this a try. I have very sensitive skin with a tough beard that sems not to grow in any particular grain. OK, so it has 5 blades; truth is it doesn't shave any better than the model with 3 but the blades are hideously expensive. I also have the 3 blade power model which is another bad joke unto itself. I still have to go over and over the same area, shave from different angles over the same space and it takes just as long and gives no better shave. True it was a nice touch to add the precision trimmer blade to the top side but I'm not sure that justifies the cost either. I will probably use the 2 blades that came with it and then put it in the goodwill bag. Oh yes, by the way, it is very pretty, if that makes a difference when you are shaving."
0,all is not well in Fusion land,"Gillette has a quality control problem with the blades. This is a recent problem, but it nonetheless has caused me to swithch to Schick disposable razors. The Gillette problem has to do with the blue strip on the razor face. The blue strip degrades after only a few shaves, and then it actually leaves a blue residue on your face."
0,Stick with the Mach III,Do not buy this product. I found that I got more nicks and cuts from using it. My skin would hurt from the extra friction. Stick with the MACH III. The MACH III does a great job. The Gillette Fusion is not worth the price. I used it for about a month - Now I'm back to the MACH III.
0,Like the rest,"I found this razor as the same as the other ones. Don't let them lie to you when you heard that this is the best one. The only cool part about it is that it has a small razor in the back that help the delicate areas like under the nose, etc"
0,"If you don't shave everyday, I would steer clear","The blades are so numerous and close together that if you have a couple of days of stubble, it becomes a nightmare to keep the thing rinsed out.So, what you end up with is a blob of your beard jammed in between the blades and you spend more time trying to wash the thing out than you do shaving."
0,Dull blades --- It sucks!,"I'm a girl but got a free one of these in the mail. Omg it sucks so bad, which is weird because usually mens razors are superior to womens. The blades are extremely dull and I couldn't shave anything with it, the head is also small and cheap and doesn't contour to curves. I had to grab my months old Venus razor to finish the job because this razor just didn't shave well at all."
0,So far no good,"I have a Mach 3 and an electric. I'm not entirely happy with either of them. Electric sometimes doesn't cut sufficiently or else chafes off skin as well, leaving it flaky and the Mach 3 occasionally cuts me. Bought this Fusion a while ago and just got around to trying it. First impressions is that it's terrible. I'm glad I didn't buy any replacement cartridges. Cut my face all over the place. If manuals have a tendency to snag on your hairs at all, it's five time worse with this (since there's five blades to snag). Additionally, there's more space between the blade guards so it's easier to cut yourself - that is, I found it hard to shave along the curve of my face/neck etc.. It kept snagging and cutting me, despite the fancy vibration. I may give it another try without the battery on to see if it works any better, but so far less than impressed. The only positive feature is that the vibration makes it easier to rinse out hair than the Mach 3."
0,Much Ado About Not Much,"Not a significant improvement over the Mach 3 in terms of closeness of shave or less nicks/irritation. Underneath my unfortunately tough & wiry facial hair is very soft & sensitive skin prone to redness, nicks and the whole gamut of after-shave horrors. For my money (excuse me if I choke up here) the Mach 3 gives the best results all around of an unavoidable daily experience."
0,Good to irritate skin,"Apparently I'm not the quickest person as it took me a few months to realize why my face was so irritated. Razor burn and acne like i was in high school again was what this razor did for me. It also hurt, and a clean shave looked 8 hrs old. 5 blades cutting at my face was just to much for me. I've actually reverted back 60 years to a 1950s model Gillette Safety Razor, Badger brush, and mug of shaving cream. The shave is 10x better. It's closer, non irritating, and is an enjoyable experience. If your having skin problems, they may be from these new super duper shavers!"
0,Simply terrible,"I gave it a try for pretty much the last year until I ran out of blades that I had pre-purchased. I'm done with this razor and already went back to the M3 Turbo, which in my opinion is the best of all of the gimmicky razors.Two main problems with this razor, it does not feel sharp and just drags along your skin and hair almost pulling them out making it pretty painful to shave. Secondly it does not even shave that close meaning you have to endure that torture more often.I can also add that this thing is way too big to be able to actually shave any contours or other ""detail"" parts of your face comfortably, even with the little mini razor on the front. It just doesn't work.Also of worthy note is that the blades do not last nearly as long as the previous blades on the M3, in my opinion these are almost single use blades as it gets increasingly more uncomfortable to use after even the first use."
0,The worst I have ever used,"This is an upgrade? This razor is terrible. I usually let my facial hair go for a few days and then shave. The system worked great with the Mach 3 but I decided to ...upgrade. Big mistake, this thing is like shaving with a dull saw. Back to the Mach 3 for me."
0,Fusion is the worst Gillette razor yet,For those that find the Fusion a good razor... I will sell you my blades for 90% off because I will be throwing them out. Its the worst razor by gillette ever! It causes razor bumps where no other gillette razor ever did this. I got hairs growing in about 5 hrs into the day where other razors kept me smooth all day. Mach 3 is the best gillette razor ever made. My girlfriend who shaves her legs with my razors refuses to use them again. They are that bad!
0,Not as good as you think!,"NOT HAPPY AT ALL with the Fusion! I thought it would be the best razor ever (based on the quality and reputation of the Gillette brand and all that advertising). Did not give me a close shave at all and found the razor catridges to be duller than previous models (like the MACH5 and Turbo). The ONLY good feature was the single blade on the reverse side - great for evening out side-burns, but other than that I do NOT reccommend. I switced back to the MACH5!!!"
0,"Make it SEVEN blades, maybe we'll talk.","Look. I already got three freakin blades on my razor, this is just two more. Eff it, you know? Just eff it. Call me up when you invent SEVEN blades and see if I care THEN. I hate Gillette."
0,One word.....Garbage,"It's a shame how Gillette keeps trying to grab more money from its loyal clientele especially with this piece of garbage. I got a free Fusion razor in the mail and hated it from the first day. The blade and the so called ""lubricating strip"" were literally worn out by day 3. With the cost of replacement blades, even purchased in bulk, what it costs to use this thing would require most people to get a second job! Stick to Sensor or Sensor Excel, does a better job and is MUCH cheaper."
0,Razor,This is not a good product (Gillette Fusion Razor) especially if you have a beard. The blade head is cumbersome and mine (I do not know if it is defective or not) squeaks. So for me new is not always better. I say DO NOT buy.
0,Terrible,"I normally use a Sensor Excel two-blade, so I thought I would step out of the stone age and give this a try. Big mistake. This razor irritated my skin to the point of bumps. The is probably because even after five or six strokes, the fusion would miss spots that the sensor got in one stroke. So with 5 strokes at 5 blades vs. 1 stroke with 2 blades, it's no wonder the fusion was more irritating. The blade is also much too big to shave very well beneath the nose. The thing that made me want to try the fusion was the precision trimmer, which looks like it would make sideburns a breeze. Alas, it was worthless. I now believe shaving technology peaked with two-blade designs and I shudder to think what 6-blade nightmare Gillette might be announcing in June. Hopefully it doesn't bump sensors off the shelves. Just in case, I'm going to calculate the number of shaves I'll need for my predicted lifespan and buy enough sensor excel cartridges to last me."
0,Don't Buy It,"I have to shave every day. This is not a good shave. It is very uncomfortable on the skin. The Mach 3 is a much better shave. I tested both for several months, each one for a week or so. Each one is the power handle which definitely helps. The fusion is rough on the skin, I even received nicks on my skin. I don't know why this is. Don't waist your money and time. I tested them for several months because I thought more blades would be better but are not in this case."
0,Not that impressed,"I bought this razor because I had run out of Mach3 blades and remember this being advertised on television. I know that Gillette has made great razors in the past so I bought it. The design, I would give it 5 stars however, the single blade trimmer is not all that effective and like many of the reviews above it is very difficult to clean. The five blades however did not run as smoothly across my face. Yes it gave me an incredibly close shave the first couple of tries but on the third day i felt that I was sawing at my face and having to do multiple strokes in areas just to cut the whiskers."
0,not nearly worth the money,"It gives more irritation than the Mach 3 Turbo, and doesn't shave as close."
0,The worst blade I have bought in 40 years,I thought I would try a new razor and saw the fushion. I am totally disappointed and actually threw out the razor and refills before I used them all. I have never cut my face so much with a razor and by five shaves the blade was done. This is the worst system gillette has ever released - my mach three is far superior. I tried the Schick hydo 5 and it is a pleasure and leaps and bounds better.
0,Blood everywhere,"I typing this with 9 fingers, having nicely cut the 10th while mishandling this massive, unwieldy razor, which I received as a gift. My face has nicks on it for the second day running - corners of the mouth, where it's hard to maneuver this brick. I shave my head as well as my face and frankly this razor scares the heck out of me, it's an unnecessarily complex and overdone gadget brought to you by the company that in the 1960s (and this is a quote from Wikipedia about a well-known fact) ""was accused of exploiting customers by forcing them to buy rust-prone [carbon steel blades]"" because it ""held a patent on stainless blades but had not acted on it"".Thanks Gillette, for putting profit before product and customers. I never had a problem with the Mach 3. Hopefully my finger will heal in a week or so but this razor is going in the trash today."
0,This razor is terrible,"I just bought and used the gillette Fusion razor. Halfway through I said the heck with this, and got my trusty mach 3 turbo out.The razor is just too big. It feels like your shaving with a butcher knife or something. I'm returning it to Target today after work. Seriously, don't waste your time or money. It's not worth it."
0,Forgotten Star Best Forgotten,"I was quite excited to discover a book set in the area of the country where I grew up. When I saw the 5 star rating - I couldn't wait for the book to arrive. No words can truly express my disappointment with this book. Mr. Leonard's story has potential, but I had trouble following it due to all of the grammatical errors and typos. The storyline was a good one, but it was impossible to comprehend fully due to the poor editing job. Mr. Leonard might have writing skills, but his decision making skills when it comes to editing leads to the demise of this book. Margot Durning deserves better."

0,Junk!,"Don't waste your money! I ran my jewelry through it 4 times and it looked the same as when I put it in the machine. I even bought the jewelry cleaning solution to put in it, and it made no difference. As for all the ""crevice-cleaning bubbles""-there were about 10 bubbles. The worst part is that it can't even be returned-no returns unless it's never been opened or used! What a ripoff! I could have just thrown the money out the window!

0,too expensive,"Wow, just put the gun away…this product is way too expensive for the quantity. One can find quality cleaners for half the price."
0,Slow read,"There wasn't much of a plot. The author, used commas, just about, everywhere. Made it very difficult to read. It might have been avant-garde when it was introduced in the early 19th century but now, it's just a slow read where nothing happens."
0,What I Know: This Book is Literary Torture,"I read about halfway through this book, and then I gave up. I read James' ""Turn of the Screw,"" and ""Daisy Miller"" in high school, and I remember liking the former and thinking the latter was just okay. (I know, I know, it's a major classic by one of America's most celebrated writers, but just because something has merit doesn't mean I like it better.) One of my all time favorite books was James' ""Washington Square."" It's hard for me to believe that the same man wrote ""Square"" and ""Maisie."" This book is only for MAJOR Henry James enthusiasts."
0,What Maisie Knew.....Do I Really Care?,"I am not a Henry James fanatic, as a matter of fact, this is the first work of his that I have read, and with that I must say that this novel is horribly written and completely unrealistic in it's portrayal of the child, Maisie and especially her dialogue. I have been assigned to read this for an english class as an undergrad and I have tolerated many a badly executed idea...but never like this. Boring, boring, and more boring. And as a result, I am comnpletely turned off to James other works. I hear his other works are great.....read those first, you may fair better."
0,Murky and weird,"I don't regret having read this book, but I wouldn't recommend it to anyone who isn't already into Henry James. The style is hard to understand, apparently because it was dictated, and the subject matter is even more obscure. I don't think Henry James had much experience with children: even assuming that Maisie is twisted by her strange situation, she doesn't talk like any child I know or can imagine. Weird moral undercurrents and jealousy take up most, if not all, of the novel. I wouldn't take claims of this book's modernity too seriously - it's more on the byzantine side. Read The Europeans instead: so much more fun!"
0,Headhunters Good - Price HERE 2X as much,"It's unclear to me if this is the Headhunter bolt, which is recommended for my Predator XBow (375 fps). The price on this site is exorbitant!!! Look around -- you can get a 5-pack for about $37 and free shipping. If you really look around, or you want to buy in bulk, you can save even more. NEVER pay more than $8/bolt, which is about what Barnett charges on their site, and other sites online $6 - 7/bolt. I like the Headhunter, but if you're target-shooting, don't go for tight groups, because you'll destroy your bolts. Also, with the Rinehart dense foam targets, you have to use some kind of arrow lube (even soap), or the heat generated by the friction will bond the foam to the shaft of the bolt. Makes it very difficult to remove bolt from target, and then you have to scrape little pieces of the target off the shaft. Even with the lube, I still have to use a rubber grip, and sometimes my feet, to remove bolt from target."
0,Broke within a day or two.,Got these for my son for Christmas to protect his eyes while target shooting with his airsoft gun. They broke within a couple of days.I would not recommend.
0,don't waste your money,"This book was a complete waste of money. I learned nothing that I didn't already know. The author also has a preachy, holier than thou style that is extremely grating. I was embarassed to have spend good money on this book."
0,Rules light,"This book contains dated material. As of january 1, 2008 the Rules and the decisions of golf have been substantial changes. All of then good and many of them will come into play every day. Also, the author references 5 dumest interpretations and goes on to state that Rules officials should not be so strict in interpreting the Rules. While that may be a nice thought, the realities are that the writers of the Rules (The USGA and The R&A) put enormous thought into the way the rules are written so that Officials in the field can uniformly interpret the rules. The Officials have no room for error in ensuring that all players are playing by the same rules and playing on a level playing field. It is an interesting book, just don't make any wagers based on what you read inside. If you really want to understand the rules purchase the publication: Decisions on the Rules of Golf from the USGA."

0,"bad item, it crapped out","Xantrex Technologies XPower Pocket Mobile Power Source 175-Watt Inverter #813-0291I used this product for about 10 days and then it stopped working, it would overheat and making a high pitched beeping noise with no power output. I would invest in a higher quality inverter, I wish I never wasted my money."
0,Different Product -- NO Airplane Adapter,"The delivered product was different from the product listed on this page: The delivered product had NO airplane adapter, despite the product description and the linked manual stating otherwise. Since I bought it specifically for use on an upcoming plane trip, this product is completely useless to me. Instead, the product contains an extra cable to connect it directly to a car battery; it also includes a connector for the standard cigarette lighter.If you are only planning to use this product in a car or from a car battery, it may work fine. However, if you are planning to use it on an airplane, you are out of luck."
0,It failed and I goofed,"Xantrex Technologies XPower Pocket Mobile Power Source 175-Watt Inverter #813-0291It totally pooped out and failed after only a few months occasional use. It worked fairly well on some things like 85 watt curling iron and cellphone charger. It would recharge the laptop but struggled to power the laptop if the laptop battery was low. This despite the very low power demand rating on the laptop.Recently on a long trip it just wouldn't work any more. We looked it over, tried a different cord on it, and it wouldn't respond. Forgetting it had a one year warranty and having no room for dysfunctional stuff, we tossed it in the trash. Rats!We are shopping for a 400 or 500 watt inverter now. This one was marginal for our laptop and we need to be able to count on the inverter for the things we need it for. I wouldn't recommend this tiny device."
0,Almost DOA... broke right away,"I was excited to be able to plug everything in without a car adapter... but this stopped working within a month of buying it. I had a close look at it and some of the wires weren't connected all the way, as if they'd been yanked out or (as I'm sure is the case) never assembled correctly to begin with. At the same time as I say don't buy it, I'm not sure which one *is* good because I never tried a different one."
0,No plug for airplane,"Please be ware, that this inverter does not have the airplane plug. No bag either. The inverter's size is small. This product does not match the user manual. The user manual might be an old version. I gave it one star since I need it with a airplane plug."
0,irritating to deal with,i didn't get to use this product because i never recieved it in time for the deadline needed. the return policy is horrible and they charge a restocking fee (even though my item was unopened) so don't buy anything unless you are absolutely sure you need the exact item.
0,disappointed,"Xantrex is a leader in the inverter field so I was very surprised when this product failed almost immediately. I returned it to Amazon for a prompt refund and bought one from Jensen, which has worked perfectly."
0,Very Dangerous!!!!!!,I would not recommend this toy to anyone.....My daughter got it for her first birthday. She liked the noise it made. She stood up to push it and it took off really fast. She bumped into another toy and it tipped over forwards. She flipped right over with it onto her head.......I am packing it up and taking it back to the store right now. The toy ruined her first birthday party by her getting hurt.......I recommend you do not buy this item...
0,Dangerous - flips easily!,"I had this for my daughter and it was cute and all. However, when the V was opened and she would walk, if she would lean to right or left the thing would flip right or left. Get ready for a crying toddler. The front wheels are closer together than the back wheels, same idea as a 3 wheeler was when they were legal...this thing had the tendency to fall over each side of the V. I would not recommend this. I sold it at my yard sale. I just got another one as a gift from family and I will be returning it."
0,This toy should be recalled!,"My son likes this toy, but the back wheels keep falling off! Every time he runs into an object with it, one of the back wheels falls off, and the thing falls over on him, and he ends up under it. No matter what we do, we can't push them in so that they stay on, even when we hear them ""click"" into place. Also, when we try to put the sides together to let him ride on it, the latch that keeps it open is so tight that it takes two of us to switch it. It was a gift, so we can't take it back to the store, but I am going to contact Fisher Price about the wheel problem."
0,Too Fast,My daughter whom is 10 months old and is on the verge of walking received this as a gift. Its cute and she loves putting the balls in the hoop and getting them out again. The problem is when she gets up and pushes it she has to nearly run behind it where as she falls to her knees. It would be alot better if she could push it instead of it dragging her.
0,"Bad Design, Limits Walking...","We bought this for our 1 year old. He loves the music but there are 2 design flaws that prevent it from being used more. First, when closed for a ride-one toy, his feet drag. There are little returns spouts for the balls, but the are not big enough to put his feet in for rolling. They also limit his ability to walk/pedal it. Second, when the seat is open, the wheels are not open far enough apart. Therefore each step forward is kicked directly into the wheels. This is cute, but if your kid has legs, you should keep shopping."
0,The worst toy we ever bought,"We bought this for our 9 month old so it could help him to give his first steps. Once ge tried to use it, the walker slipped and he fell and hurt himself. The wheels have basically no friction so this is definetely not the toy for those babys strating to give their firs steps."
0,HORRIBLE & DANGEROUS!,"I purchased this for my 1 year old daughter. I just want to say that this toy is dangerous and I hope they take it off the market. It is too heavy in the front and not enough weight in the back so when your ""not yet walker"" tries to push it, it topples over and my daughter did a summer sault over the toy and nearly hurt herself!!! I am calling Fisher Price. DON""T BUY THIS!"
0,AWFUL,"We bought this toy for our son, and with in 10 minutes realized it needed to return to the store. He is just learning how to walk, and this is not the toy to help a child learn stability. Not only did he have a difficult time pulling himself up due to it moving, when he did it rolled away leaving him face down. For me, this falls under the don't waste your money."
0,UNSAFE,"My daughter got this toy for Christmas. She ejoyed it at first, but we soon discovered it is very front heavy. She kept tipping FOrward and hurting herself. PLEASE DO NOT BUY THIS TOY!!!!"
0,What a disappointment!,My son is just turning 10 mos & I thought this would be a good toy to help him explore walking. Well he wanted nothing to do with it. He fell off several times trying ride it. I can't imagine a much older child trying to ride it. It is very low to the ground. He did enjoy throwing the balls down the hallway & under the furniture. For the price I will just go buy him some balls to play with. Also it is extremely hard to take apart to return. Whew what a work out.
0,Poor Walker,"My son was never able to use this toy for a walker. The speed of the toy never allowed him to push it as he learned to walk. I would much prefer a walker with a speed control. The height of the toy was also a challenge for my son. As a walker, he had to bend over to far, and as a ride on he sits to low to the ground. My son is tall for his age, but he has not been able to use the toy for a walker or ride on from age 8 months to 16 months. He is now to tall to use it at all."
0,Not stable... not safe!,"We bought this walker for our son when he was 10 months old. It's terrible and I am surprised that Fisher-Price would market such a dangerous toy! It's too heavy in the front and tips easily. If you use it on a hard floor, it moves way too fast for a beginner walker. My son tried to walk with it and fell flat on his face! The wheel popped off a couple of times. And the space between the two legs is too narrow and my son kept getting his feet caught in the legs!The only saving grace to this terrible toy is the fact that my son likes to press the nose to hear the music!VERY DISAPPOINTING!Kathy - mom to 2 yr old"
0,"Durable, but not too safe","We gave this to my 8 mth. old and I have to agree that it does go too fast and he had a hard time keeping up, thus he ended up falling. He also can't change directions, so basically he goes until he runs into something. Also, it does flip forward from time to time when he leans on it as well. When he falls or it flips, he sometimes bumps his chin on the handle which is too rough for that reason--probably needs to be made of rubber. Sometimes his feet bang against the legs of the walker as he's moving and causes him to fall. He does enjoy the balls and putting them in the basket. The music is quite entertaining. It is a durable product, but not as safe as I would have liked. He hasn't used it yet to ride on, so I can't speak for that aspect."
0,The box is better then the toy...,I recieved this toy as a gift and i was very upset when i opened the box! it is puiny compared to the adds for it and the picture on the box... the wheels move way to fast and my daughter fell and hurt her chin! i returned this toy in 2 days of buying it.. waste of money needless to say...
0,walker moves to fast.,"I got this for my sons 1st birthday. As of yet he won't attempt to try the walker feature anymore because everytime he's tryed to stand up and use it, it speeds off in front of him. It needs some resistance (maybe on carpet would be better?) Very disappointed because i got it for him to learn to walk. The sit ride on feature doesn't interest him to much either. He can push to go backwards but hasn't figured out going forward yet. The ball in the hoop hasn't clicked on to him either. The one thing he does love is the music and lights but that only attracts his attention for a very short while. I hope it grows on him as everyone else seems to love it."
0,upset,"i am writing to let you know i am not happy with this toy,,,my 14 month old grandson almost broke his foot when it became lodged,thought i would let you know,wanted to know if it can be returned,so this does not happen again,,,,,thank-you joanne gordon"
0,parent of 1 year old and 3 three year old,"I was so excited for my 1 year old to practice walking with this toy, thinking that she would be so encouraged by the constant funky music. My 3 year old was ""helping"" me put it together for her. The problem was that the music only played when the nose button was pushed and not at any other time as it's supposed to do! The kids got bored with it within minutes. Unfortunately, once it's assembled, it can't be taken apart for return purposes so I lost my money. I would purchase another walker instead if I were you ( one that's returnable)."
0,"Baby Loves it, I think it's CRAP.","My baby boy loves this toy. I think the toy is unsafe without perental supervision. First of all, there is nothing to slow it down. My child starts walking with the toy, and then Zooooom, it's speeding away and my baby is falling down on his face and chest. Bottom line is that something need to be included that will slow the wheels down for baby's learning to walk. Second of all, if my child runs into something with the toy. . . say the chair, and keeps pushing, the toy will flip forward. This causes my child to fall forward, onto the toy, hurting himself. If your unable to totally supervise the baby while he/she is playing with this toy, don't buy it.... Really."
0,My son never took to this toy.,"My son never took to this toy. The ""ball game"" portion of this scooter/push toy was the highlight of the whole toy and that kept his interest only a few minutes, then it could have been just any old ball. He is in the 90% for size and it was too awkward to be a push-toy (he tripped over the wheel walls) & there is very little room for legs and feet if you want to use it as a scooter.Sorry, but for us... this toy was a big thumbs down."
0,"Great in theory, poor in actual use","We purchased this toy for our 10 month old son who was already happily cruising on the furniture. We thought this would help him 'cruise' around the house. Instead he wound up on his face more often than not. The wheels go WAY too fast, and it was only safe to use when we were walking behind him and holding on to the handle so it didn't run away. The basketball feature was promising until we realized the balls come out the back end. What a dumb idea! It's as if the balls were there.... and now they're gone forever.Ours is taking a trip back to the store."
0,Be careful with this toy!,"I bought this for my 10-month old daughter who was just starting to pull up on everything in the house. I thought this toy would be great to help her walk. But the wheels are extremely slick and have no traction (do NOT use on tile or wood floors) and have absolutely no resistence to them. Every time my daughter would try and pull herself up using this toy it would start rolling backwards and if I helped her stand and hold onto it the wheels rolled so quickly when she tried to walk forward that the toy would get away from her. That really frightened her! Also, the music is annoying and LOUD, without a volume control and the slightest little thing sets this toy off.Overall, the concept is OK, but if you do get this toy (which I do not recommend) make sure you hold onto it at ALL times when your child is playing with it if they are standing or else they are going to fall on their face when the toy rolls away from them."
0,Not good. Doesn't Turn. Goes too fast.,"Bought this for my daughter when she was starting to cruiseShe was never able to use it to walk bc it goes too fast. She did enjoy sitting on it, but it was pretty useless since it can only go straight and a 1+ yr old isn't really capable of figuring out how to get up and turn it around manually. She would end up riding on it until she could go no further and then just getting up and walking away. It has been a thoroughly diappointing purchase. . I have only one positive comment: the two tunes it plays are cute --but annoying-- and they can be turned off. But that is not a reason to buy this one. I recommend either buying one with steering control, or a walker that doesn't go as fast. I'm sorry that I can't recommend another option, but at least I can warn you not to waste your money on this one."
0,Horrible walker,"As a mother of 4, this was our worst walker. Too small for them to actually use as a stabilizer when learning to walk. Then, too small to use as a ride on. The legs open to walk, close to ride. When open there wasn't enought room to step. While the music & lights were entertaining, all of our other toys are too! The worst part is that when put the ball in the front, it comes out underneath in the back. Our kids always cried wondering where the ball went. We highly recommend the very simple little tykes car as a very strudy ride-on/walker. It comes in pink or blue with the right hight handles on the back for pushing, it won't tip over, & is big enough to use a ride-on!"
0,flopped,"We bought this toy as a walker for our son to aid him. The wheels have no way of slowing down the walker so it didn't help him at all. If he leaned on it, it just moved out from under him while he was trying to hold on for support. Also with the seat in the ""apart"" position, it's impossible for the child to stand close to the handle bar so his hands are way out in front of him trying to hold on. And then it just zips out from under him. I'd say if you want a ride-on toy, then it's fine. If you want assistance for learning to walk well, pick a different toy."
0,Difficult and annoying,"The music sensor is TOO sensitive. You walk on the floor a little too hard the annoying music goes off! I don't mind the musical toys at all but this one is ANNOYING. The balls should go toward the front once they roll into the basket. My almost 12 month old couldn't find them. He looked in the front. It is not easy to walk with or ride on. It is VERY DIFFICULT to move the blue seat apart to become a ride on or a walker. It is most difficult to pry the legs apart to make it a walker. My strong husband had a difficult time. He's an engineer and said it is not designed well at all. This also tips over easily. My son was behind it and the music went off, he bent forward to find the music and he went head over heals with the toy on top of him. I gave it 3 stars for durability because we haven't had a problem with it falling apart but it tips easily to me that's not durable."
0,Falls over easily,"My 10 month old got this walker as a gift. She loves it, but I stopped letting her use it because I think it is dangerous. It has fallen on top of her a few times. The last time she fell, her legs got entangled in the sides of the walker and she hit her head on the floor. That was the last time she will ever use it."
0,Item should be redesigned or recalled,"I got this when our baby was 5-6 months old. He enjoyed sitting on it and pushing it around. Unfortunately as other parents have reviewed this item, you cannot leave you kid alone when he/she is riding on this since he can easily topple over. It is light in a sense that my baby just lifted the whole thing with one hand! Also, the wheels have nothing to slow it down that it moves faster than your baby can walk. He/she will end up squat on his face if he/she lets go. If the front wheel hits a snag, it becomes a pivoting point then the whole body acts like a trebuchet toppling your baby forward.If you can fully supervise your baby, this is a good one otherwise I would not recommend it. We had to return ours for the sake of safety of our baby."
0,do yourself a favor and don't order,This toy has the most obnoxious song. It plays over and over with the slightest movement.. I have bought many toys and this is by far the bigest wasted of money.
0,Junk!,"I got this walker for my daughter because I thought it was cute. The walker is horrible! It has a button that needs to be pushed while you push the two legs together, impossible for one person alone. The button on mine wouldn't go down, making it impossible for it to turn into a rider. It's not sturdy or worth the money I spent so I returned it."
0,Not what we expected!,"I purchased this walker as a christmas gift for my 9 mo. old son. I wanted a toy that would aid in his learning to walk as well as a fun toy. After assembling (which was very simple), we found that this toy's lightweight frame and lack of tension on the large wheels causes it to go too fast and the child to topple forward. This toy is NOT MADE FOR BEGINNERS...BEWARE!!"
0,disapointed,"im giving two star for the begginning of the movie. as i started to get interested in the movie, it ended. very dissapointing.."
0,The worst among my phuchases,"There are no explanations at all on the answers. The answers are only A.B.C.etc. They did not tell you ""why"". Besides, the CD sound quality is so bad, and you can not repeat the specific questions you want to listen. You have to repeat the whole section from the beginning, and it wasts my time.It can't even compare to Delta's Key to TOEFL(CD-ROM)(5*) and Barron's TOEFL 10th Edition(4*),"
0,Luxury but not good for instructors,"It's too fancy and nice, but it is heavy and the handle is long. It is hard to carry around. The handles get hot when playing summer time."
0,Loose Lid and Handles Have No Clip to Stay Together :(,"After reading the reviews, I bought this hopper. The price is great and it felt pretty solid as I assembled it, but then noticed that the top lid does not latch down or close tightly. This is a problem because if you put this in the car and it tilts over... all the balls will come out. Second issue is the handles/legs when folded upward for carrying have no latch to keep them together. When I first attached the handles/legs then sat it in the carrying position, about 10 seconds later one of the handles fell down and broke my dog's bowl on the floor. I knew right then that it had to go back. I am now looking for one with a tight lid and a latch for the handles. Hope this helps you :)"
0,Disappointed,I was unable to play this movie because it was set up for Europe not USA . Really wish I knew that. It was a gift.
0,What the Hell?!,"I am SO INTO 80's horror movies, slasher flicks, even low budget kinda cheesy fun killer movies. I bought this because it received good reviews, lots. Well, I was disappointed big time. This movie sucked. It really didn't deliver too much in the gore and action department. I just hate when something is so built up and doesn't deliver."
1,great hoop,"my son loves this hoop, as well as his two younger sisters! we have it indoors for now and we love it!"
1,Tip for Assembly,"I just put this toy together for my nephew. The instructional manual suggests soap when you try to put the post into the base. It really does help, though I used hand lotion instead, so it's not as messy. (It made a world of difference - without it it's quite difficult to put it together.)"
1,Great toy - very durable -,"This hoop was a little difficult to put together - directions are read easily, I just needed a strong man to do a couple of the steps. Other than that, we love it. My 3 year old loves playing w/ it and learning how to get the ball in the hoop. It is durable and clean - we currently have it set up inside but when we adjust it as she grows we will move it ouside. It was worth the money."
1,Basketball,"This gift was a perfect choice. My two year old grandson (and his four year old sister!) are having great fun with it. Great quality, speedy delivery - perfect and highly recommended."
1,a bear to assemble,"Other reviews warned me about the difficulty to assemble this and they were right. It took three adults to get the backboard onto the post. But once it was together, it looked very slick. Our grandson understood the concept right away and we're glad it can grow with him."
1,Great product!,"Our son is two and a half, just over two when we purchased this. He uses it all the time, it seems very durable, works great, and has good balance even without filling with sand. We keep this inside right now and he shoots hoops every night. If he reaches up and grabs the net, he can pull it down on himself, as we have no sand in it right now, but it's light enough, that it shouldn't hurt him much even if he does. With a little coaching, he doesn't even pull down on it any more, and we've never had a problem. If you're worried about this at all, just fill it with some sand and this won't be an issue. We are very pleased with the looks, practicality, and durability of this product. From all of the basketball hoops we looked at, I truly believe this was the best for our needs, and we still have a lot of growing we can do with the adjustable backboard."
1,Years of fun for a 2 year old,"I love this hoop. I'm not sure who was more excited for it, me or my two year old son. He loves it and does slam dunks on it all the time. He is only 2 now and I can see him using the basketball hoop for another 5 years. Great buy. I was not dissapointed."
1,Christmas Gift,"I purchased this gift for my grandson (almost 2). He is very active and doesn't like to sit still for very long at all. I felt this would be a good toy for him to use inside and outside, as well as grow as he grows. He really loved it. His dad thought it was great."
1,It's a hit,"We got this for our 2 year old for Christmas, and it has to be his favorite gift. Everyone in the house enjoys playing with it, too. We love the hoop itself. The only issue that I had was with how it was delivered from Amazon. It came in it's box, nothing covering the outside of the box, so you could clearly see what it was. I'm just glad that the little one didn't see it before we could tuck it away."
1,Great Item,"Purchased this item for our preschool, children ages 2-5, and it works perfect for all the ages. They have so much fun! Will probably purchase another one too."
1,Grandson LOVES it,I purchased this for my 23 month old grandson and he absolutely loves it. He plays with it every day and invites anyone else who comes in the house to play it with him. The assembly instructions were easy to follow ...even late on Christmas Eve. Looking forward to watching him grow with it.
1,we're really happy with this set,"Loading it with sand is a futile process, the sand gets obstructed and you have to shake it to clear it adding only a few pounds at a time. Some of it can hold water which could lead to breeding mosquitos. We have it indoors in the winter and it is hard to not walk buy and take a few shots!"
1,Great Developmental Toy,"We got this for my 18 month old son. At its lowest setting, my son can just about lay the ball over the rim. It raises to 6 feet high which should keep him interestd for a long time. Qualitywise, it should last for several years."
1,Grow to Pro Basketball,"I purchased this toy for my 22 month old grandson that needed to develope motor and stretching skills. It has worked out wonderfully, he still needs PT and OT but playing basketball has made that part of OT fun for him. It's sturdy, from the use and looks of it should last several years."
1,Buy this for your little hoopster!,"Our son has been playing on this since he was about 18 months and just loves it! With the ability to increase its height, we look forward to many years of him hooping it up on the Grow-to-Pro Basketball Hoop."
1,great for 6-10 year olds,easy to assemble but be careful putting on the backboard stickers (do it right the first time or it is hard to remove and do over). fun for little kids since the height goes down to 4 feet. sturdy but definitely need to fill the base with water or sand. I hope it lasts a long time in the sun (especially the stickers).
1,Tyke basketball hoop,"My grandsons really enjoy the basketball hoop. The only problem with it is the base. When assembling the stand column to the base, the column projects beyond the level of the base making the base wobbly and unstable. I had to add two 2x4s underneath on either side of the column to stablilize the base. Once that was done it works well."
1,Fisher-price I can play Basketball,I ordered this for my 2 year old granddaughter . She loves being outdoors and loves balls . It is perfect size for her and can be adjusted as she grows . The package came very quick . I always shop with Amazon .
1,Sturdy build. Assembly a little tough.,"It's a great basketball hoop. We bought it to replace a cheaper one we'd bought that was hopeless. This'll survive all but the most zealous beating from a toddler. Assembly was simple, but some parts were hard to 'click' together. That shouldn't put you off, as they're presumably like that to provide robustness once assembled.I don't think it's going to help my son grow to be 7ft tall, however."
1,Great toy!,Bought this basketball hoop for my son 2 years ago(he will be 6 this summer) and he still loves to play with it! I love the fact that the height can be adjusted as he grows. :) My MIL even went out and purchased one after she saw ours. Now that she has four grandsons and 3 granddaughters...it sure will get good use!
1,Hit!,"My husband put this together without much trouble on Christmas morning, and our 3 year old loves it! I thought the all would be regular-sized, but it is smaller. It seems to be the perfect size for my boy, though, and that's good enough for me!"
1,Basketball hoop,Kids love it. Its adjustable and seems durable enough. It is great for indoors and outdoors. I would definately recomend this product.
1,My son's favorite thing,"My 20-month-old son's favorite word is ""Basketball"". Well, more like ""Baah Baawww"". But you get the picture. He loves dropping balls into this basket. This product was extremely easy to put together, and very sturdy. It's plastic, of course, so you can't hang from it for too long. But it's holding up very well to our super active toddler. He's 3 feet tall and we have it set to the lowest position. He is able to push a ball over the rim and into the hoop without standing on anything or without throwing the ball. He CAN throw it if he wants to, just trying to give you an idea of how tall a kid would have to be to reach the hoop. :) We currently have it set up in our living room, and we had plans to put water or sand (or kitty litter) into the base to secure it, but it turns out that we really don't need to. It's sturdy enough without a heavy base."
1,quite nice except for the net,"We have had this basketball goal outdoors for 1.5 yrs now. My son plays with it a bit. It turns out that he is not a basketball lover. Regardless, it looks good. It is under a cover, but it does get sun half the day. It has not faded at all nor has the sticker on the front peeled. It really looks great except for one thing -- the net. The net has deteriorated to 1/4 of its original size. If you touch the net, it collapses into a white powder. Literally, 3.4 of the net is gone. I wish the net were made of more a fishing line type material.....something that weathered better."
1,I Can Play Basketball,My granddaughter loves this product. She is only 3 1/2 and plays basketball at the YMCA. The best thing about Fisher-Price I Can Play Basketball is that you can raise it as the child grows.
1,Very good,My friend's son got it as a gift from us and he loves it. He is two and I purchased this product because it can last him for a few years.
1,Great hoop for my toddler,"I bought this basketball hoop for my rough-n-tough two-year-old, and he loves it. It was fairly easy to put together, and I've had no problems with it falling over or coming apart. Best of all, a regulation basketball fits through the hoop!"
1,basketball happy,I purchased the fischer price basketball hoop as a gift for a four year old little girl and she loves it. The nice part of the gift is it will grow with her and it seems really durable so I think she will have it for many years to come.
1,"pretty sturdy, and good size","son absolutely loves this, and it has held up well. Haven't used the larger height yet but will soon have to keep down the tomahawk jams. So far so good, ball return is a nice touch too, but is usually what my son hits his head on."
1,good value and good for all ages,"I bought this for my 2 year old and my husband. We use this product indoors and am hoping to have it for at least 3 years. The plastic seems sturdy to take everyday beatings.Playing with this has become a family event. Even visitors can't resist playing. I feel that by buying this, my son can not only stay indoors from the heat, but he practices his coordination and gets physical exercise. After work, my husband and I play with it to relax. This is an overall good toy. Since it only comes with one ball, I've purchased those cheap plastic balls for continuous play. The return is a huge plus.I've only had this for over a month, but so far, I think I got my moneys worth."
1,"Important Work, Good Translation","In this work, Adam of Bremen discusses the history of Hamburg, Saxony, and Scandinavia from the 9th century on from his perspective within the Catholic Church in Saxony. He provides a great deal of important information about the times, though naturally his bias shows through frequently.Adam of Bremen seems to have clearly held Tacitus in high regard, perhaps even as a role model, as this work reminded me of Tacitus's in structure while at the same time using ""Germania"" as the basis for the first few chapters.I found this translation to be very readable, and the introduction was quite helpful in understanding the history behind the academic understanding of the text. For anyone interested in the history of the Middle Ages, or in Scandinavia, this work is highly recommended."
1,Great Product!!!,"This came well packaged, on time and the quality is perfect for my beading/necklace/ bracelet projects. I will definitely be buying more of this product and check out other colors available! Thank you"
1,Linda Arnold CD,"""Happiness Cake"" is another great CD from Linda Arnold. Although many of her songs are for preschoolers, several are just perfect for my second grade students. I use all of her CDs and love her upbeat songs."
1,love it,"I taught preschool music for 17 years and Linda Arnold was my very favorite artist to use! Her music is creative, playful, magical!!! I used to call her and special order (cassettes in ""the old days"" and) CD's so the parents could buy them. I didn't want the children to grow up without Linda's music being part of their lives. I personally raised two sons, who still love her music and are starting to use it with their own baby boys. Be SURE to buy Happiness Cake, Make Believe, and Peppermint Wings."
1,Finally!,"Recommended by one of my cooking magazines, these are perfect for saute'ing, frying, and cooking."
1,Wrong Item,I think if you bought your GPS from QVC you bought the model #2950 not the #2750. It would not be fair to review the 2950 here.
1,funky and beautiful,"i got this cd some years ago as a present to myself for a small job i got working at work. i fell in love instantly, and really listened to this a lot. i'm a huge fan of the brand new heavies, who really bring such a soulful sound to everything they do. and i'm a big fan of old school rap and hip hop, including many of the artists featured on this cd. personally, i think this is a mix made in heaven. i expect that many of you who enjoy the good sounds of funky and old school hip hop will enjoy this, too. its not much like the rest of the BNH stuff, so don't go in expecting a typical sound from them. however, do go in expecting some of the best soul and funk based hip hop to hit you."
1,hold on,this cd is so dope. It is great old school hip hop over really tight insturments. This is what I feel influenced the roots and ozomatli( at least cut-chemist suite). Not like most of the other Heavies stuff but definetly solid. The reason that it gets 4 out of 5 stars is because the cd starts and ends solid but there is a lull in the rhyming skill in the middle. Definetly one to pick up and throw on during a party.
1,"MAN, I FORGOT HOW WONDERFUL THIS ALBUM IS!!!!","man, i tell you what, i was just reminded about how lovely this album is to listen to. i had the tape, but i lost the tape. right after i ordered it on here, i find the cotton pickin' think hiding in a doggone bag!!!! nevertheless, this is wonder fusion of funk and hip hop. why it did not get more attention than it did, i do not know. it was a breath of fresh air for '91/'92. you just do not hear that type of thang anymore. if they did it today, they would probably be club bangahs in the form of jazz. shameful!!!!!"
1,Best of the post-Godley-and-Creme era,"10cc's first album without two of its original members, Kevin Godley and Lol Creme, is a perfectly agreeable effort, if a bit straightforward for longtime fans. ""The Things We Do For Love"" is a memorable single, and the epic ""Feel The Benefit"" recalls the band's previous inclination to totally change styles in the middle of a song. But beyond that, most of the songs are straightforward late 70's pop. There are novelty songs here, like ""Modern Man Blues"", but nothing so bent and memorable as ""Rubber Bullets"" (from the self-titled first album). So, if this is your first 10cc CD, you'll probably find their earlier ones more eccentric, while if you start with the early stuff, the middle of this disc may drag.IMHO, the really neccessary 10cc CD's are this one, ""10cc"", and ""The Original Soundtrack""."
1,"Post split up, there's still life in 10cc.","Oh no - 10cc have split up - what are we to do! I'll tell you exactly what...hit that shopping basket button and put a wide smile on your face! With the release of 'Deceptive Bends' Stewart and Gouldman reaffirmed their status as master song writers. You won't find any of the saccharin overtones of the pop orientated early 10cc here. This is the band at their very best - refined and polished until the album shines from start to finish. Prior to attempting this review, I took an objective view at the track listing...not a lemon amongst them! 'The things we do for love' alone justifies buying this album. It's no good, I'll have to stop and give the old faithful plastic copy a listen - see you in paradise!"
1,Karin Herzog Cleansing Mild,"This cleansing milk is light and creamy and leaves your skin soft and clean. No residue, rinses off easily."
1,Excellent!,"This is the only recording of Norman Dello Joio's beautiful ""Bagatelles"" that I know of--and it's wonderful. This CD introduced me to composers Salzedo, Forst, and Delmas--who are amazing, also.This was an easy 5-stars."
1,Very good watch,"The watch is very elegant. Its very sleek, small and thin. The mother of pearl dial is very shiny too. The reason I gave it a 4 star is because the watch I received for the first time was defective and did not work properly even once. I got it exchanged and the new one works perfectly."
1,Had to have it!!,Great handbook. Easy to carry with you as a reference or to have on the work desk. I would purchase the other handbooks for other areas of the body.
1,Great little book,Loved this book for anatomy review just wish it included the head portion of anatomy.
1,Barely Legal- A must have for ECW fans,"If you call your self a ECW fan, you have to have this DVD because it's ECW's very first ppv. And it was a pretty damn good ppv too. RVD is in this ppv, and If your a ECW fan I don't have to tell you why that's a good thing. Plus Terry Funk wins the World Title in two great matches. All in all a great DVD. A must have for a true ECW fan."
1,Interested? Here is the complete card:,"Terry Funk vs. Raven for the ECW World Championship; Pitbull #2 challenges Shane Douglas for the TV Title; The Dudleys take on The Eliminators in a tag team title war; Terry Funk, The Sandman & Stevie Richards go all ut in a three way dance; Lance Storm takes on ""Mr. Monday Night"" Rob Van Dam; Taka Michinoku/Mens Teoh/Dick Togo vs. Great Sasuke/Gran Hamada/Masato Yakushiji and finally, in the MAIN EVENT: The most brutal bout of all time; ""The Human Suplex Machine"" Taz fights Sabu."
1,Gift of Divine Grace,"Father Gawronski's beautiful work is a gift of Divine Grace. I humbly recommend this book, along with Father Gawronski's DVD of Dom Inacio's (Saint Ignatius') Spiritual Exercises - a truly marvelous door into the Holy and immense contribution that Saint Ignatius makes to our precious humanity - May the Lord Bless Us."
1,"Excellent for identification, but not for general information","The book does have an introduction talking about the broad classifications of types of oaks, history of oak usage, historic management of oak forests, etc. But this introduction is short, and then the book gets into the nitty-gritty of identification. Not just red vs. white, but every single documented variant the author found in his extensive research. For all but one of these oaks, the author visited and examined a live specimen himself."
1,Before The Willennium,This is a good CD but it needs to have some more popular tracks in it. Where's Summertime? Boom! Shake The Room? And stuff like Dumb Dancin' isn't a very popular track. It's a good CD that you'll get hooked to (like all the other DJ Jazzy Jeff & The Fresh Prince CD's) but I think Greatest Hits is a better buy.
1,Outstanding music from a band of outstanding musicians,"Even though this album doesn't have the consistantly great material of earlier Renaissance albums, Michael Dunford's composing and Annie Haslam's singing make the album worth owning. The final song, ""The Flood at Lyons"" is easily one of Renaissance's best efforts even keeping in mind the excellence of their earlier albums. Several other tracks are also superb. This album is definately worth owning if you are a Renaissance fan."
1,Renaissance's Mainstream Effort,"By the time Azure D'or was released in 1979, Rennaisance was transitioning from progressive compositions to a more pop or hit oriented sounding band. Gone were the lengthy songs, replaced by shorter compositions that still retained the mix of acoustic and orchestra instruments but with more synthesized sounds added to the final mix, masterfully put together by producer David Hentschel. Basically a continuance of songs similar to those in the previous album ""A Song for All Seasons"", Azure D'or's songs are relatively short but catchy tunes with Annie Haslam's wonderful voice giving life to somewhat obscure lyrics. The best cuts are ""Jekyll and Hyde"", ""Golden Key"", ""Kalynda"", ""Friends"", and the stoic ""The Flood at Lyons"" where her voice soars through intricate time and key changes. If you're a fan of progressive bands of the 1970's and Rennaisance at its peak of success, this album is a must."
1,Works fine,"Kinda expected something bigger, heavier, and more sturdy but it works as designed. My wife stole mine so I need to buy another."
1,"Solid, useful product","I've been using the Lapworks Laptop Desk Ultralite for a few weeks now. I have a Macbook Pro that gets ridiculously hot after a while but this product has really helped keep the heat off my lap. The laptop fan doesn't turn on nearly as soon as it did without using it. It's definitely more effective when used in the 'folded' position where there is a space between the computer and your lap. I was surprised to see how rugged this thing is for how light it is. It's even strong enough to use as a tray when I move the laptop. This is especially effective since it has very 'grippy' rubber pads that keep the laptop from sliding off too easily. I've used it to travel, putting it inside my laptop case with my laptop and it took up almost no additional space and added negligible weight. I'm totally satisfied with this purchase and I recommend it highly."
1,This is a great product!,"I gave this rating a 5 because I am rating the PRODUCT... not the shipping. Shipping was 25% of the overall total. Other than that, the Ultralite works great! My laptop does not get hot, I have a lift so my hands are in the right place, it's so durable I can lift it with my laptop on it, move to another part of the room, and have no issues of the plastic cracking or my laptop slipping off the lift. I ordered this in Nov 2008 and use it each time I pull out my laptop. Everyone that has seen my Ultralite wants one. Let me tell you, I don't get easily impressed. I am impressed with this product. The shipping cost needs improvement."
1,"A nice, simple reference book.","This colorful children's book shares Chinese stories and legends of the creation of the world. Stories include Five Heavenly EmperorsYouchao and the First Dwellings, the Cowherd and the Weaving Girl, and Nuwu Mends the Sky. Chang-Er Flies to the Moon and other stories illustrate popular stories for various celebrations such as the Mid-Autumn Festival. Each story is dramatically illustrated with symbolic and mythic Chinese images. A nice reference book for children (and adults) who are interested in Chinese legends."
1,Me and my amazing body,"I loved the book and enjoyed reading it to my grandson. He seemed interested also. He is2 1/2 yrs. old. My son, his father, seems to think that some of the pictures in itshould be a boy as well as girl."
1,Perfect ice therapy for travel,"This ice pack was great to take traveling because you can fill it with the hotel's ice. Unlike other ice therapy bags that need to use a freezer to recharge the cold. The only thing I would have liked would have been ties instead of the velcro. I have a broken foot and used this to reduce the swelling. The bag doesn't wrap around my foot the way I wanted it to. Also, after taking the velco straps on and off kind of shredded the material on the outside of the bag . It probably would work better on a body part that is straight, like an arm, leg, etc. Otherwise, I was very happy with the fact that it did not leak or sweat all over the place."
1,Superior migraine help,"This is the best ice pack you can buy. Just fill it with ice, snap it closed, and it's leak-free and stays DRY. It also last a LOT longer than those gel-packs."
1,So much great information,"This book is a great resource and delivers a lot of information in a very systematic format. Of all the books that I have read in preparing to convert, this has been the most useful."
1,I speak for 'She Speaks'.,"Fabulous book; fabulous tool. Purchased 'She Speaks' for my 12 year old daughter as a tool for audition prep work. She was caught up in it and is reading if first as a collection of short stories. My daughter is thouroughly involved in the book and will enjoy it as a preperation tool so much more after reading, feeling and experiencing many of the situations captured by it's pages. A wonderful work."
1,Alloy Steel Set Screw,"If color is a factor when purchasing this item, know that it is black. This item worked perfectly to lower the turn signal lights on my 2009 harley sportster 883 iron. i used it in conjunction with a 1 in. long 5/16""-24 coupling nut."
1,was hoping for...........,"A little disapointed that songs from a good album back then.Lets put it all together had more than one song too pick from too be one this compilation.And also the (heavy)album had some too.But anything is better than nothing since there is virtually nothing on later reissues from this label on this artist.Which I still too this day don't understand.Their is people out here all over the world who would buy once they know they are available.The albums I mentioned and(you are beautiful).Three that would bring good money too this label.But it does have some not on previous hits albums.So pick it up you will be happy you did.And its good background music when company is over,or at work or in the car.Everyone of all ages and cultures know this music.Its music that will be around forever.Generation too generation.A Legacy,something unfortunately todays music cannot say."
1,Great Compilation,"Worth every penny. I cannot stop listening. Every song I have always loved, and more. You cannot lose with The Stylistics."
1,price differ on package then what they charged me,"The music arrived just fine but the price on the package said $9.99 I was charged $19.00 I agreed to pay that even though I thought it was a bit much, they could have taken the actual price tag off of the package so I didn't look so much like a unsuspecting nut."
1,Great music DVD standard,"This Eagles music DVD (dts version) should be the norm and standard for all music DVDs. The production is just first rate. The music and video were done with such ease, professionalism, quality, and technical expertise, that we forget all these virtues as we are magically immersed with the great audio. All fans of music, whether or not they are Eagles fans, should be quite impressed with the quality of these effort. This is definitely a must buy for your next music DVD. My only peeve is the lack of any other bonuses other than the quite lame audio-only ""Seven Bridges Road"". Regardless, there's a lot of good music, good performances, and just a ""peaceful easy feeling"" while watching this masterpiece. Buy it and enjoy. If you don't have a DTS-capable sound system, this is a good reason to have one."
1,When Hell Freezes Over DVD,Outstanding value and fast service. This DVD was not available in local retailers so it was great to find it on Amazon.
1,"The Last Resort.....Buzzing sound, kind of funny.","Hi, I've owned this DVD since it was released, and my wife and I still watch it at least, 2-3 times a month. I just wanted to share a part in the concert where my favorite song, LAST RESORT starts. If you watch Don on the stool in the beginning, he starts to get worried and his head turns back and forth, and suddenly there is a look of disgust on his face. If your system can pick it up, he is upset over a BUZZING noise, and it goes away. I thought it was priceless. I can feel for him. I know he's a perfectionist. With their music I would be too. One last thing, why couldn't somebody SHUT that guy UP!! in the audiance who was yelling ROCK and ROLL constantly. He should've gone to a Metallica head banger!! The Eagles 'ROCK' real well, without making ear bleeding noise. Their passion for their craft, and music is second to none. The adding of Joe Walsh in '76 gave them all the rock they needed. Thank Mr. Walsh for that influence."
1,The best,"If you have a need to listen too some eagles music, this is the one DVD you will want to listen too over and over again also lets you listen in dolby true surround!!"
1,Hell Has Frozen Over,The concert on this video is superbly put together. It has two more tracks that were not put on the LP. It has a different but MUCH BETTER song order
1,NEVER SAY NEVER,"I THINK THE TIME PERIOD THAT THE EAGLES MEMBERS WERE APART MADE A POSITIVE EFFECT ON THIS ALBUM. THE OVERALL SOUND AND THE BACK-UP VOCALS ARE BETTER THAN EVER. I STRONGLY SUGGEST IT TO EAGLES FANS. WE ALL REMEMBER THAT THEY SAID THE RE-UNION WILL BE WHEN THE HELL FREZES OVER. I THINK THE TITLE OF THEIR NEXT HIT SHOULD BE "" NEVER SAY NEVER ""."
1,A Gift,I surprised my husband with the Eagles DVD's for Valentine's Day. He really likes their music and I think it is his favorite DVD now!!
1,Hell has not quite frozen... :),"This is a great concert which I have been listening to on the audio CD for nearly two decades... I am thrilled to have the complete video now, and hope I don't wear it out from over-watching ;)"
1,Of course this is an awesome DVD...,If you luv the Eagles this is a must have. It has the longest playing music and is one of the best Eagles has made to date !
1,GREAT DVD,"WE ARE EAGLES FANS, BUT LOVE ALL MUSIC. WE HAVE BEEN DISSAPOINTED IN A LOT OF MUSIC DVDS, BUT NOT THIS ONE. THE MORE YOU WATCH IT THE MORE YOU LOVE IT. GREAT OLDIES AND SOME REALLY AWESOME NEW STUFF. WE ARE EXCITED ABOUT THE EAGLES AGAIN.GREAT SOUND AND PICTURE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
1,"BEST CONCERT EVER ""DTS"" ONLY","Perfect, Just Perfect. My tongue gets tired if i talk about this ""EAGLES"" concert. All I can say is that the DTS makes you feel like your in with the Band. In the DTS sound you can listen to the ""STRINGS"" of the Guitar from the left and right speakers and you can hear every instrument in the concert. Also, you can hear the clapping and whistling of the fans from the rare speakers. AWESOME, if there's a rating more than 5 stars i would give it 110%, I listen to it every 2 days. Check out RANDY TRAVIS LIVE concert, it's also a G-R-E-A-T Concert don't miss it. ""DTS"" OF COURSE."
1,not enough stars,"I never was much of an eagles fan but this dvd has converted me, songs that were once just ok were amazing. I really dont know what to say, it was a very enjoyable listening experience. This is an absolute must have for those of you with DTS systems period!DTS is simply amazing, those of you that think Dolby Digital can come close should purchase this DVD and experience what true 5.1 audio is all about."
1,DTS DVD Eagles - WOW!,Close your eyes and you can FEEL the Eagles perform in your home. This is the most masterful audio production I have ever heard! This recording makes other DTS DVD titles only wish they were so awesome! This sets the new standard for audio DVD's. If you have DTS DVD this title is an absolute must have!
1,AWESOME!!! Perfect audio!!,"Unfortunately, it was not recorded in an higher quality of imaging, since it was a 1994 show, but the sound.... OWE!!! Awesome!! Perfect!!"
1,This is the BEST Eagles DVD out there.,I have a great DTS system with Yamaha reciever and Klipsch speakers that made this DVD a fantastic experience. I've watched this many times and the sound is first rate. Everyone who watches and listens are amazed. If you like the EAgles...you'll love this as one of the best concert DVD's out there....Buy your DVD's from Amazon.com! ...
1,What a band!,"This is one incredible DVD. Yes, I am a huge Eagles fan. However, this is an Eagles lover's dream. Maybe they did it for the money...but who cares. The only bad part was going to black between songs.Glenn Frey and Don Henley are the Lennon/McCartney of the seventies. Great singers, too. Don Felder and Joe Walsh were once compared to Eric Clapton and Duane Allman...I think they are way better collectively. Timothy B. Schmidt is a fine bass player, but his vocals are purer and stronger than Meisner's.People have talked about supergroups...THIS is a supergroup."
1,Timeless music,"I already had the VHS tape. The pictures are much sharper on the DVD and I think the music is also better. My ears pick up on accents and music notes very well. The Eagles--Hell Freezes Over is almost perfect. The guys made it look so easy after some 14 Years.....By the way, my teenage years were in the fifties...."
1,Simply the Best,"Simply put, to my ears, it is ""the"" best music dvd by which all others will be judged. The DTS version is a must but DD 5.1 version also makes it a must to own."
1,Great video and sound - Eagles Rock,"This DVD is shot so well that it can be used as a video demo. I highly recommend this disc any Eagles fan and for people who just like good music. As much as I like this DVD, I was surprised that the Eagles did not perform the song ""New Kid In Town"". [A song from their Hotel California LP/CD.]"
1,Outstanding video clarity and spectacular DTS audio,"In terms of visual and audio quility this is the best music DVD I have yet seen or heard. I can't speak for the PCM track because when you hear it through DTS there is no reason to listen any other way. The music on this disk flat out sounds great, and the quality and clarity of the photography is top rate."
1,FANTASTIC!!!,Just like being at an Eagles concert!!! Has some songs I've been trying to find on CDs. I'd recommend this to any Eagles fan!!!!!!
1,One amoung the best,This is one amoung the dvds I prefered the best of home music entertainment. Recorded in both dts and pcm stereo I could play it on both dts and ordinary reciever or amplifier.
1,The Best Music Video DVD ever so far?,"Saw this DVD and was MINDBLOWNED!! Really, the quality of both the DTS 5.1 sound as well as the Video was top-notch. Highly recommended to all Eagle fans. And yes please have a DTS decoder. It really is awesome."
1,Damn,This is the best of the best. I would like to see another concert by The Eagles. The DTS experience will make you want to convert all of your DVD's to DTS. Spend the money on the equipement to enjoy every ounce of this performance.
1,"Never Broke up, just took a 15 year vacation..",Why did we have to wait for 15 years. This DVD is the best of The Eagles. They are just amazing. There will be no other band like them again. Everyone should have this DVD in their collections.
1,UNBELIEVABLE!!!!,This dvd has got to be better than actually being at the concert. The DTS sound is amazing. This was like actually having the eagles in my living room doing a private concert. If you don't have a home theater surround sound system...buy one before you watch this...you won't regret it!
1,Eagles Live Forever,"This video just proves that once you rock, you always rock. The Eagles play, sing, and perform with all the intensity they use to. It is MY personal favorite music video and if you like the Eagles it will be a favorite of yours too!"
1,The Eagles: Hell Freezes Over - DTS,The best sound DVD I have heard without really being there in the live audience
1,eagles the band,I bought the DVD because VH1 classis airs it every once in a while and I liked what I saw...so I had to purchase the DVD and I could watch it anytime I want. The DVD did come on time as promised and the condition of the DVD was in good condition.
1,""" BEST OF MY LOVE "" IS MISSING IN THIS DVD","I love Eagles since 1972, their songs, drums, guitars, bass guitar, pianos playing are great ! Timothy's bass guitar playing is fantastic particularly in the titles of NEW YORK MINUTES and HELP ME THROUGH THE NIGHT. The DTS copy sounds better than the other one. The acoustic guitars do not sound enough, a pity ! Even I increase the volume of front and rear speakers, the guitars solos still sound weak. I miss the song "" Best Of My Love "" which is not included in this title. Anyone who doesn't buy this DTS DVD will be sorry for their lives !"
1,Truly amazing sound for a live performance!,"Definitely *THE* dts dvd to show off or test a home theater system. ""Seven Bridges Road"" (dts bonus track) vocals are awesome, with a distinct voice coming from each of the five channels. If you are even the slightest fan of The Eagles, you should give this a listen!"
1,AMAZING!,Amazing performance! Acoustic Hotel California blew me away! Why couldn't The Beatles bury the hatchet before Mark David Chapman decide to play God?
1,Quality of Sound,"Enough people have reviewed about the album and hence I will stick to the quality of sound. I brought this DVD as a reference DVD for my music setup comprising of Klipsch speakers, HK 635 amp linked using Monster THX cables/inter-connects mostly brought from Amazon. The quality of music listening to the DTS is amazing and really make you proud about your investment on hardware. As is being reviewed by hifi buffs, I almost started listening to each and every instruments separately and this is where the danger starts. Music is supposed to be listened to as one, when you have more and more expensive music systems, you will end up listening to some un-heard sound, missing the song. There should be a limit to the ""separateness"" needed for people who loves Music and I think I have almost crossed that limit with my set up."
1,Not Enough Stars to Do this Justice!,"Easily the best concert DVD ever produced IMHO. I can't understand how any music fan/audio/videophile could speak out on this title in a negative fashion. The engineering behind this dvd sets a high mark for others to meet in the future. If you only buy one music dvd, this is the one to have. Do yourself a favor and invest in a quality DTS player, amp and speakers to fully enjoy this work of art!And I'm not even a big Eagles fan! Can't wait til there's a Clapton dvd of comparable quality!"
